		offers advanced theming concepts and functions which can be used optionally. These concepts
		are outlined in detail below.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">CSS Variables, Functions and More</h2>
			<p>SAPUI5 uses the popular
				CSS preprocessor <a href="http://lesscss.org/" title="http://lesscss.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
					LESS</a>. This tool introduces several features, including CSS variables, a
				concept which has also been heavily demanded by the CSS community: In any
				UI5-controlled CSS file, variables can be defined and can then be referenced
				anywhere in the CSS code of the same library. These variables are mainly used for
				colors. All CSS variables are global. The CSS variable concept contributes to a
				consistent way of implementing and changing the styles.</p>
			<p>LESS adds more features like color calculations, mixins, and CSS selector nesting.
				The color calculations are used in SAPUI5 to derive many
				different color shades from just a few variables.</p>
			<p>Here is the syntax:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">@sapUiText: #000000; /* define the text color as 'black' */

button {
   color: @sapUiText; /* buttons will automatically have the current text color, which is '#000000' right now */
    [...]
}
</pre></div></section>
			<p>LESS then takes care of substituting all references to a CSS variable by the current
				value of this variable. This happens during the build of the control library.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>In development scenarios this LESS processing might even happen at runtime in the
				browser to shorten the build time for SAPUI5 libraries. This
				is indicated by a <span class="ph uicontrol">less mode</span> rectangle when a page is
				launched.</p></div></div>
			<p>Additionally, a specific theme can modify the CSS parameter values given by the base
				theme. So a control can just define its text color to use <code>sapUiText</code>
				by default which will automatically take care of applying the correct color for
				every theme or user modification: The theme generation will create one CSS file per
				theme, and the substitution of the CSS parameter references will always take the
				theme-dependent value into account. So a visually very different theme can easily be
				created by simply changing a number of colors.</p>
			<p>While every library and control can introduce their own CSS variables, those defined
				in <code>global.css</code> are most important. Ideally, there should only be
				a few of them, and they should be simple enough to be understood by most end users
				(similar to what the Windows operating system offers end users), but still cover as
				many aspects of the visual appearance as necessary to make them sufficient for most
				customer-required theme modifications. </p>
			<p>Additional benefits of CSS variables are, for example:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">They can be used to generically build simple styling tools that allow for a
					limited degree of freedom (=changing the CSS parameter values). The UI theme
					designer is an example of such a tool.</li>
				<li class="li">They can also be linked to metadata, for example, to which group of colors they
					belong, to which colors they need to have some visual contrast.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="title ">Compilation of One CSS File</h2>
			<p>SAPUI5 CSS generation does not
				only substitute the CSS variable values but also merges all CSS files of a control
				library into <span class="emphasis">one</span> file that is loaded at runtime, thus
				increasing the performance.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the reasons why you would not want to have all styles defined within
				one file during development:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Less collisions and merging when different developers edit the styles of their controls</li>
				<li class="li">Clear separation between the styles for different controls, which helps to estimate and test
					the impact of a CSS modification</li>
				<li class="li">Keeping the door open for future optimization regarding runtime performance and data
					transfer by tailoring CSS files on server side that only contain the CSS
					required on the current application page</li>
			</ul>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Optimization and Compression of CSS Size </h2>
			<p>For performance reasons, the SAPUI5 CSS generation can optionally remove all comments and unnecessary whitespace and
				can compress verbose declarations into a more compact format.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Base Theme for Generic Style</h2>
			<p>While some of the style and layout applied using CSS clearly depends on the current theme, and
				customers are likely to modify such style rules, there are other style rules that
				are required for a control to work properly and unlikely to differ for different
				themes. Examples are the overflow behavior, the positioning of popup elements, the
				mouse cursor type, the display mode, and others.</p>
			<p>SAPUI5 promotes and supports keeping those style definitions in the so-called base theme,
				which serves as a common base for all themes.</p>
			<p>Themes are built upon this base style that defines their specific visual design by applying
				colors and images, sizes and fonts. SAPUI5 theme generation
				takes care of combining the base theme with the specific theme for each generated
				theme CSS file. Because the specific CSS is appended to the base theme, a specific
				theme can always override styles defined in the base theme. If this step is required
				often, the respective style declaration should probably not be located in the base
				theme.</p>
			<p>Any style declarations which are referencing CSS variables (at least those common ones defined
				in the base theme) can also be done in the base theme, and it is sufficient to do it
				only there: The CSS generation will apply the correct value for each respective
				theme. So this split between base theme and specific themes avoids duplicate
				creation and maintenance of CSS parts which are common for all themes and keeps the
				CSS files that need to be written for any new theme smaller.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Generic Right-to-Left Support </h2>
			<p>For some countries, right-to-left (RTL) text mode needs to be supported. In order to
				avoid the need to create a completely new set of CSS files for those countries, SAPUI5 supports generic
				RTL generation. Basically, this involves switching the right and left margins and
				mirroring everything else (including CSS3 rotations, and so on).</p>
			<p>Everything else that is not covered by this automatic transformation can be fixed by
				using style rules that are only applied in the RTL case.</p>
			<p>If you override RTL-specific attributes like text alignment, positioning and so on,
				you have to write the RTL equivalent into your application CSS. The attributes below
				are critical for RTL support:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>float</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>clear</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>text-align</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following attributes require special attention:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>margin</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>padding</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>border</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>background-position</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>position</code> (right/left)</li>
				<li class="li"><code>text-indent</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Depending on the values, these latter attributes might also need to be mirrored. As
				applications running in RTL mode add a <code>dir</code> attribute to the HTML
				tag in the DOM, custom styles that have to be written can use the following selector
				to handle RTL-specific styling:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">html[dir="rtl"]  .myselector {
}</pre></div></section>
