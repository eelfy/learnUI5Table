			<h2 class="title ">Data Reduction</h2>
			<p>In this section, you can reduce the number of data records that are sent to the
				frontend for this analysis step. The top n approach is useful if you know that for
				this analysis step it is sufficient to look at the most relevant data records only
				instead of sending all data points to the UI.</p>

					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>Add "top &lt;n&gt;" to the title of the analysis step, for example,

				</p><p>The top n values you see in the analysis step are not necessarily the highest

					<li class="li">
						<p>If you sort by revenue in ascending direction, you get the bottom n
							instead of the top n.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Filter Mapping</h2>
			<p>This section becomes visible when you choose a selectable property in the

			<p>Filter mapping is useful when a selection that can be made in one analysis step cannot be
				handled by a subsequent step. In this case, the system determines the source filter
				property based on the selections made in a chart and maps them to other filters that
				can be used in the requests for subsequent steps in the path (target properties).
				Filter mapping is optional, that is, if the fields are not filled, no filter mapping
				is executed for this step.</p>
			<p>Define the lookup request that maps the source property to the target properties as follows: </p>
