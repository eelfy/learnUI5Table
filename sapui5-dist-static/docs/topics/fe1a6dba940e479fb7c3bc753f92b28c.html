		detection and mitigation of certain types of attacks including cross site scripting and data
		injection.</div><p>CSP restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, such as scripts,
			fonts, and images:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>CSP mitigates and reports XSS attacks; CSP compatible browsers only execute scripts loaded in
					source files that are received from allowed sources.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>CSP also mitigates packet sniffing attacks by specifying the protocols that are
					allowed to be used in the web server, for example, specifying that content must
					only be loaded from HTTPS.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>CSP is either enabled via a configuration in the web server to return the
			Content-Security-Policy HTTP header (preferred solution), or via the &lt;meta&gt;
			element in the meta tags of an HTML page.</p><p>For generic information about CSP, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/" title="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/</a>.</p><p>For SAPUI5, we recommend that
			developers build their apps CSP-compliant, in particular regarding the loading of
			resources and the use of inline scripts. <code>eval()</code> is currently still
			required in SAPUI5 for
			synchronous loading. However, we recommend to load JavaScript resources asynchronously
			and this also avoids the use of <code>eval()</code>. For more information about
			asynchronous loading, see <a href="#/topic/91f23a736f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The SAPUI5 framework has built-in support for modularizing comprehensive JavaScript applications. That means, instead of defining and loading one large bundle of JavaScript code, an application can be split into smaller parts which then can be loaded at runtime at the time when they are needed. These smaller individual files are called modules." class="sap-doc">Modules and Dependencies</a>. For
			more information about avoiding synchronous APIs which might lead to synchronous
			loading, see <a href="#/topic/491bd9c70b9f4c4d913c8c7b4a970833.html" title="Overview of the replacement of global functions with the factory functions" class="sap-doc">Legacy Factories Replacement</a>.</p><p>To build CSP-compliant applications without inline scripts, you must avoid the following when
			developing SAPUI5 apps:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>Script element with inlined source code</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Inline event handler</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>javascript</code>: URL</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>document.write()</code>, <code>createElement('script')</code>, and
					so on, if they are used to create inline scripts. Creating script references,
					such as <code>&lt;script src="..."&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> or non-script
					content with them is okay.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>To be prepared for a CSP policy, which does not allow <code>eval()</code>, you must also
			avoid the following elements when developing SAPUI5 apps:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>new Function()</code></p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>setTimeout(&lt;non-fn&gt;)</code></p>
				<p>This will be ignored silently and not create a timer without <code>'unsafe-eval'</code>,
					that is, <code>&lt;non-fn&gt;</code> is never executed.
						<code>setTimeout(&lt;fn&gt;)</code> will work with and without
						<code>'unsafe-eval'</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>setInterval(&lt;non-fn&gt;)</code></p>
				<p>This will be ignored silently and not create a repeated timer without
						<code>'unsafe-eval'</code>, that is, the <code>&lt;non-fn&gt;</code>
					is never executed. <code>setInterval(&lt;fn&gt;)</code> will work with and
					without the <code>'unsafe-eval'</code>.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>To run in an environment in which CSP has been enabled, SAPUI5 requires the
			following directives:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p>SAPUI5 itself does not require
						<code>‘unsafe-inline’</code>, but still requires
						<code>‘unsafe-eval’</code> for synchronous loading of JavaScript
					resources. <code>‘self’</code> is required for loading application
					resources. If SAPUI5 is not hosted with the application, an additional source entry
						(<code>&lt;source hosting UI5&gt;</code>) is required.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p>SAPUI5 requires
						<code>'unsafe-inline'</code> as it is used by many controls. In
					addition, <code>'self'</code> may be needed for loading styles from the
					application. If SAPUI5 is hosted
					with the application, <code>'self'</code> is required for loading the SAPUI5 styles.
					Otherwise, an additional source entry (<code>&lt;source hosting UI5&gt;</code>)
					is required. Similarly, the location of custom themes needs to be added.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>font-src 'self' &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p><code>'self'</code> may be needed for loading fonts from the application. If SAPUI5 is hosted
					with the application, <code>'self'</code> is required for loading the SAPUI5 fonts,
					otherwise an additional source entry (<code>&lt;source hosting
						UI5&gt;</code>) is required. Similarly, the location of custom fonts needs
					to be added.</p>
				<p>Some specific SAPUI5
					functionality may require specifying <code>data:</code> as source.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>img-src 'self' &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p><code>'self'</code> may be needed for loading images from the application. If SAPUI5 is hosted
					with the application, <code>'self'</code> is required for loading the SAPUI5 images,
					otherwise an additional source entry (<code>&lt;source hosting
						UI5&gt;</code>) is required. Similarly, the location of custom themes
					needs to be added, if they contain images.</p>
				<p>If the backend provides additional links to images, their location needs to be
					added as well.</p>
				<p>Some specific SAPUI5
					functionality may additionally require <code>data:</code> and/or
						<code>blob:</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>frame-src &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p>For using the support assistant and/or the diagnostics tool, the location of the
						SAPUI5
					framework (could be <code>'self'</code>) needs to be added as a source
					entry.</p>
				<p>Additional entries may be required depending on the integration, application, or
					test scenario.</p>
				<p>Some specific SAPUI5
					functionality may additionally require <code>data:</code> and/or
						<code>blob:</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>worker-src &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p>Some specific SAPUI5
					functionality may require the source hosting SAPUI5 (could be
						<code>'self'</code>), <code>data:</code> and/or
						<code>blob:</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>child-src ;</code></p>
				<p>For browsers not supporting <code>worker-src</code>, the corresponding
					entries need to be done here. This is the deprecated predecessor of
						<code>worker-src</code> and <code>frame-src</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p><code>connect-src 'self' &lt;source hosting UI5&gt;;</code></p>
				<p><code>‘self’</code> is required for loading application resources. If SAPUI5 is
						<span class="emphasis">not</span> hosted with the application, an additional source
					entry (<code>&lt;source hosting UI5&gt;</code>) is required.</p>
				<p>Some specific SAPUI5
					functionality may require <code>wss:</code>.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>To setup a most restrictive policy, setup CSP in report-only mode and start with a
			minimal policy. Monitor the reports to add missing sources. Finally switch CSP to
			enforcing the policy. </p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
