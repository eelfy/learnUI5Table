			<h2 class="title ">Creating a New OData Service</h2>
			<p>The easiest way to create a new OData service in an ABAP back-end system is to establish a
				Core Data Services (CDS) consumption view and generate the OData service from this
				view (data-source driven service creation). Combined with Service Adaptation
				Description Language (SADL) this provides the following advantages:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>CRUD request handling is covered by a Business Object Processing
							Framework (BOPF) model that can be implicitly generated and controlled
							by the following
							annotations:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">@ObjectModel.writeEnabled: true
        @ObjectModel.writeDraftPersistance: '&lt;BO name&gt;' 
</pre></div></section><p></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Locking is handled by BOPF (implicit lock with modification requests)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Paging is implicitly handled by SADL</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Draft document handling is implicitly covered if
								<code>@ObjectModel.writeDraftPersistance</code> is specified.
							However, you must also specify annotations, as defined in the draft
							specification.</p>
