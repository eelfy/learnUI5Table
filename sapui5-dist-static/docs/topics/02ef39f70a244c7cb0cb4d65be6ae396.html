					<li class="li">
						<p>When loading your app</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>When trying to find SAPUI5 controls in the app</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p><p>When loading the app, the OPA5 command can accept a parameterdefining the number of seconds to
				wait for the application to load.
				</p><section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">var opa5 = new Opa5();
opa5.iStartMyAppInAFrame("path/to/your/app.html", 30); // wait time in seconds</pre></div></section><p></p><p>When trying to find SAPUI5
				controls in the app, you can add the following settings to cause OPA5 to wait a
				different amount of time for a control to become available on the screen. You also
				need to set the QUnit timeout (to a time equal to or greater than the OPA5 setting),
				otherwise QUnit might give up
				early:</p><section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.ui.test.Opa.config.timeout = 20; // wait time in seconds
QUnit.config.testTimeout = 20000; // wait time in milliseconds</pre></div></section><p></p></div></section><section class="collapsible"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible">Who should write feature files?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>Ideally, the Product Owner develops feature files together with developers. Depending on how familiar Product Owners are with the tool, they can upload
				the feature files directly to source control, or let the developers do the upload.</p></div></section><section class="collapsible"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible">How can I avoid inadequacies when writing the step definitions?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>You may find that there is a gap between what the Product Owner has written, and the information that the developer requires to implement an integration
				test. Developers can modify the feature file to enable testing, as long as they check back with the Product Owner to ensure that the feature
				file is still correct.</p></div></section><section class="collapsible"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible">Every time the Product Owner modifies the feature file, it breaks the tests How can I avoid this?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>Actually, this is the point of Gherkin. When modifications to a feature file are uploaded to source control, we expect this to break existing tests, since
				the application's expected behavior has changed — but the application itself has not changed yet. Gherkin is forcing the application to stay in
				sync with the feature file. Consider that this also encourages you to be more honest about accepting new feature changes into your product — and
				the amount of extra work that this entails. We recommend that you use your formal code review process to allow developers to change the
				application and fix the tests, and then submit all the new code together with the feature file changes at the same time into the master
				branch.</p></div></section><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
