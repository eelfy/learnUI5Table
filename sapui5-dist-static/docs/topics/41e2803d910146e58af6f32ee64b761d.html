						<td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">
							<p>Depending on the chart type you chose, enter data such as the dimension for the horizontal
								axis and the legend, and the measure. Some chart types offer more
								fields, for example, the stacked column chart, or fewer fields, for
								example, the pie chart. Mandatory fields are marked with an
								asterisk.</p>
							<p>If you have selected both a key property and the corresponding text
								property for a dimension at step level, you can define for each
								representation what is displayed at runtime: the key only, the text
								only, or both key and text.</p>
							<p>The default label text for each property is derived from the <code>sap:label</code>
								annotation of the property. You can see that the default text is
								used when you see <span class="ph uicontrol">Label (Default)</span> in front of
								the entry field. You can overwrite the default text with your own
								label text as required. When you delete the label text, the default
								label is displayed again.</p>
							<p>Ensure that all properties of drill-down dimensions that are selected
								for the step are also used in the representation for this step.
								Otherwise the data may not be displayed correctly. </p>

								displayed in the order provided by the OData service.</p>

								level, this text takes precedence over the corresponding text
