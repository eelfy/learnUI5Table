		content densities for certain controls that allow your app to adapt to the device in
		question, allowing you to display larger controls for touch-enabled devices and a smaller,
		more compact design for devices that are operated by mouse.</div><section>

			<p>The following two screenshots show the difference between the

				a simple <code>sap.ui.table.Table</code> example:</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Checking Which Content Densities Are Supported for a Control</h2>
			<p>If you need to know
					which content densities are supported for a particular control, the best place
					to look is the <a href="#/controls/" title="#/controls/" class="sap-doc" alt="#/controls/">Samples</a> section in the Demo Kit. After choosing a
				control from the list, look at the details in the Object Header area to see which
				density is supported. In the example shown below, the control supports both the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Compact</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Cozy</span> content
				densities:</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loiobc564fc273134d5db475b08c937acef8_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>Alternatively, you can also use the filter function in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Samples</span> in
				the Demo Kit to filter the controls according to their content densities. Simply
				choose the filter selection icon in the upper left corner of the screen and then
				select <span class="ph uicontrol">Content Density</span>, as shown below:</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio18e87a860e0c426c894432634d81af22_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Setting Densities</h2>
			<p>You set the corresponding content density CSS class on the <span class="emphasis">container</span> for
				the part that you need to switch to the content density in question, not on the
				control itself. This is usually done within the administration settings of the SAP Fiori
					launchpad, but for a standalone scenario we recommend that you set it at a high
					level, such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, as in most cases you will want to
					set it for the whole
					app.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>Be aware that you can only set <span class="emphasis">one</span> density within a
						hierarchy: Once you have set a CSS class at a high level, such as the one
						described above, it cascades all the way down, meaning you cannot revoke or
						overwrite it in the lower levels of your coding.</p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p>Thus, when using densities, you cannot mix them: You must not combine
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Cozy</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Compact</span> or
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Cozy</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Condensed</span> within the same
				hierarchy.</p>
			<p> You can use densities in the following way:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="ph uicontrol">Cozy</span></p>
						<p>Make sure you always only use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Cozy</span> density
							within a hierarchy.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="ph uicontrol">Compact</span></p>
						<p>Make sure you always only use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Compact</span> density
							within a hierarchy.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="ph uicontrol">Condensed</span></p>
						<p>
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Condensed</span> is a special case and can only be used
							in combination with the <span class="ph uicontrol">Compact</span> density.</p>
						<p>Also, keep in mind that the <span class="ph uicontrol">Condensed</span> density has an effect on
							controls in the <code>sap.ui.table</code> library and their content
							only. If the density is set for controls outside of these tables, it
							will not have any effect on them.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
