			depending on the amount. This can be done using the standard
			semantic colors that are defined for states like
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>, <span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>,
			or <span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>.</p><p>The price values can be mapped to semantic states as follows:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &lt; 50: Status is green (<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 50 and price &lt; 250: Status is normal
							(<span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 250 and price &lt; 2000: Status is orange
							(<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>price &gt;= 2000: Status is red (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>) </p>
				</li>
			</ul><p></p><p>As we use Test Driven Development (TDD) we define the test case first, before we actually
			implement the feature. So we will now start by implementing a test for the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Price State</span> feature. Naturally the test will fail until the
			feature is implemented in the next step.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

				</p><p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development model that relies on a very short
					development cycle. When using TDD a developer first writes a failing automatic
					test case to describe the behavior of a new feature or functionality. As soon as
					the test fails (due to the still missing implementation) the role of the
					developer switches to the implementation. The code is added to make the test run
					successful and then the cycle starts over again.</p>
				<p>There might also be iterations where just the implementation or testing code is
					refactored to make it more elegant. TDD reduces complexity while maintaining
					high test coverage of the application coding at the same time.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Unit Test Setup</h2>
			<p>All unit tests are located in the <code>webapp/test/unit</code> folder and can be
				started manually by calling the <code>unitTests.qunit.html</code> file in
				the same folder or the entry page. This HTML page is a QUnit runner that calls all
				unit tests of the app and displays the test results in a readable format.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>Some testrunners like Karma do not require an HTML page to invoke the tests but work with configuration files instead. They can directly
						invoke the <code>AllTests.js</code> file and log the test results in their own format. Therefore we make sure that the
							<code>AllTests.js</code> file does not contain any UI output and just calls the various test cases of the app.</p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loiof25ffee0c48947bca16249c229654d69_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div><span class="collapsible-icon sap-icon figcap title">Unit test infrastructure in the application</span></div>
			<p>Let’s take a closer look at the <code>unitTests.qunit.html</code> file. The
				application root is stored in the <code>webapp</code> folder two levels
				above. In the <code>bootstrap</code> tag of the HTML page we define two
				namespaces to refer to the app and the unit tests. The namespace of the unit tests
				points to the current folder as all test artifacts are located below the current
					folder:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>sap.ui.demo.bulletinboard: "../../"</code></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>test.unit: "./" </code></p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>The namespace abstraction allows us to refer to all application and testing parts
				without having to use the full path. Furthermore, all unit tests are put in a
				similar folder structure and get the same name as the artifact that is tested. For
				example, the tests for the file <code>webapp/model/formatter.js</code> are
				located in the <code>webapp/test/unit/model/formatters.js</code> folder. For
				more details on the unit test setup please have a look at the coding of the
				prototype.</p>

			<p>First we think about the feature that we want to implement. We want to introduce a
				new state for the price, and its value should depend on certain price ranges. SAPUI5 controls
				typically have semantic states like <span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>,
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>, or <span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>. We will need
				this formatter function to convert the numeric price value from the model to a state
				value for the control. But without caring too much about the actual implementation
				of this formatter we just add an empty function <code>priceState</code> to the
				formatter file for now and focus on the unit tests first.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js</h2>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.ui.define([
	"./model/formatter"
], function (formatter) {
	"use strict";

	QUnit.module("Number unit");
		…
	<span class="emphasis">QUnit.module("Price State");

	function priceStateTestCase(oOptions) {
		// Act
		var sState = formatter.priceState(oOptions.price);

		// Assert
		oOptions.assert.strictEqual(sState, oOptions.expected, "The price state was correct");
	}

	QUnit.test("Should format the products with a price lower than 50 to Success", function (assert) {
		priceStateTestCase.call(this, {
			assert: assert,
			price: 42,
			expected: "Success"
		});
	});

	QUnit.test("Should format the products with a price of 50 to Normal", function (assert) {
		priceStateTestCase.call(this, {

			assert: assert,
			price: 2001,
			expected: "Error"
		});
	});</span>
});
</pre></div></section>
			<p>Now we write tests that call the function we have just defined and check for the
				correct result when passing in various arguments. </p>
			<p>By writing these tests, we actually implement the following specification in our
				tests that was defined by the product team.</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &lt; 50: Status is green (<span class="ph uicontrol">Success</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 50 and price &lt; 250: Status is normal
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">None</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 250 and price &lt; 2000: Status is orange
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">Warning</span>)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>price &gt;= 2000: Status is red (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error</span>) </p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>Whenever we run the tests, we will implicitly check that the feature is
				still working as it was designed. To keep it simple, we should
				only write a minimum set of tests that cover the most important
				cases, but also including edge cases like the value 50 or
				unexpected values. </p>
			<p>Let’s have a look at the implementation of the unit tests now: We add our
				unit tests to the
					<code>webapp/test/unit/model/formatter.js</code>
				file. The path below the app and the test folder is similar so
				it can easily associate the test with the tested functionality.
				There are already formatter functions for the number unit
				conversion defined in the code - you can have a quick look
				before we add our own tests.</p>
			<p>We add a new QUnit module for our price state tests after the number unit conversion
				tests. We could write a test checking the result of the formatter for each of these
				cases but we do not want to repeat ourselves (<q>DRY</q>) – neither in the tests nor
				in the application coding – so we create a reuse function called
					<code>priceStateTestCase</code>. In this function, we call the formatter
				with the arguments provided as <code>oOptions</code> and make a
					<code>strictEqual</code> assertion for the expected parameter.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>There must be at least one assertion per QUnit test. If the actual value
						matches the expected value then the test is successful. However, if there
						are more assertions in a test case and a subsequent assertion fails, the
						whole test fails with the error message of the failed assertion.</p>
					<p>There are also other types of assertions, for example the <code>ok</code>
						assertion that does not check the type. For more details, have a look at the
						official QUnit documentation. </p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p>The assert object – a special object injected by QUnit – is passed on as a reference
				to the function. QUnit is loaded once for the whole unit testing part of the app. </p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>The main page for calling the unit tests is <code>webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html</code>. In this file we load the QUnit runtime
						and an <code>AllTests.js</code> file that loads and directly executes all files with unit tests. The other content of this
						file is just HTML for displaying the QUnit test result page.</p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p> And now for the actual test cases: Whenever we want to start a new test we call
					<code>QUnit.test</code> with a test description and a callback function
				containing the test logic as an argument. The callback is invoked with a special
				assert object that is maintained by QUnit. We can simply call assertions as we saw
				above. </p>
			<p>Inside each test we simply call our reuse function with different parameters for the
				price and the expected state that reflect our specification above. With five tests
				we can check the most important cases for our price state converter. There are four
				tests for the four different states and one edge case test with the value
					<code>50</code>, that makes sure that the correct state is chosen.</p>
			<p>That’s it, you just wrote your first unit test. When you call the
					<code>webapp/test/unit/unitTests.qunit.html</code> file in your browser,
				you can see that the first module for the number unit formatter is still green but
				our price state tests are red and failing. The error message tells us that the
				result of the empty formatter function is not as expected.</p>
			<p>TDD methodology tells us to do the implementation as soon as the test fails and to
				come back to testing as soon as the tests are successful again. You run the unit
				tests after each code change, and you're done when the test does not fail anymore.
				We now switch to the implementation part and define the details of the formatter
				function in the next step.</p>
