		<p></p></div></div><p>The <code>UploadCollection</code> control allows users to upload single or multiple files
			from their devices (desktop PC, tablet or phone) to an app. Due to its responsiveness,
			the upload collection can be used in containers of different sizes.</p><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Overview</h2>
			<p>You can use the <code>UploadCollection</code> control to show a list of files, for
				example, attachments or uploads, that can be modified, or you can allow users to add
				or remove files to or from this list. </p>
			<p>The <code>UploadCollection</code> control can be used in the following scenarios:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Instant Upload</span></p>
						<p>Allows users to upload single or multiple files from their devices and attach them to the
							application immediately. The selection and upload process is completed
							in one step and is automatically triggered by the
								<code>UploadCollection</code> control.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Upload Pending</span></p>
						<p>In this scenario, the upload process is divided into two steps. </p><ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p>Users select attachments and add them to the upload list (multiple selection is
										possible). Thereby, a user can delete a file of this
										selection again without canceling the whole upload of the
										other selected files.</p>
								</li>
							</ul><p></p>
						<p>In a second step, the user uploads the selected files to the application.
							The upload is provided by the application, for example, with an upload
							button or similar. To trigger the upload, the control offers an
							event.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Details</h2>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Interaction and Behaviour</span></p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Upload files</span></p>
					<p>The upload is triggered by the <span class="uilabel">Add</span> or <span class="uilabel">Upload</span>
						pushbutton (depending on the scenario). In the OS-native file picker dialog
						you can select one or multiple files. However, the consuming application
						need to enable the upload of multiple files by using the
							<code>multiple</code> property during the instantiation. During the
						upload process, a progress indicator provides information about the status.
						For upload, also Drag & Drop can be used.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Open files</span></p>
					<p>To open a listed file, you can choose the icon or thumbnail of the attachment as well as the
						filename itself. Depending on the file extension, browser capabilities, and
						device type (Desktop or mobile), the file is handled differently, for
						example, it is opened in a new tab or downloaded, if no display capability
						is available in the browser.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Rename files</span></p>
					<p>Choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Rename</span> pushbutton (pen icon) turns the file name into an
						input field and allows modification. If the
							<code>sameFilenameAllowed</code> property is set to
							<code>false</code>, the new file name is validated and, if the file
						name already exists in the current list, an error occurs, which indicates
						that you need to change the file name.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Delete files</span></p>
					<p>The user can delete files by using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> button.
						After choosing the <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> button, a dialog appears,
						asking the user to confirm the deletion of the respective file that removes
						the file from the upload list or application (the delete behaviour depends
						on the scenario that is used).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Sorting and filtering files</span></p>
					<p>The application can provide the sorting and filtering feature for the Upload Collection
						list. After setting the filtering criteria, the users get the filtering
						information displayed in the info toolbar.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>For the instant upload scenario only, the following features are
						available:</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">
							<p><span class="emphasis">Download files</span></p>
							<p>You can download a file item from the Upload Collection list and save it on your device.
								For example, you can provide a <span class="ph uicontrol">Download</span>
								button in the <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> in the header,
								and once you marked one of the items the download feature can be
								used. To use this feature, API methods in the
									<code>UploadCollection</code> control and the
									<code>UploadCollectionItem</code> control are used. Using
								the <code>askForLocation</code> parameter, you can configure
								that the browser should ask for the location where to store the file
								or not (depending on the browser). When this parameter is set to
									<code>false</code>, the download method acts in the same way
								as when clicking on the file link. If the
									<code>askForLocation</code> parameter is set to
									<code>true</code>, the browser opens a <span class="ph uicontrol">Save
									As</span> dialog.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p><span class="emphasis">Upload a new version of a file</span></p>
							<p>To upload a new version of a file to the Upload Collection list, the
									<code>openFileDialog</code> method is available. You can
								provide a button in the <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> in
								the header and if one entry in the Upload Collection list is
								selected, the API method shall be called. The uploading process of
								the new version depends on the settings for the optional
									<code>UploadCollectionItem</code> parameter:</p><ul class="ul ">
									<li class="li">
										<p> If the parameter is provided, the method removes the
											selected item from the Upload Collection list
											automatically to upload the new version. </p>
									</li>
									<li class="li">
										<p>If the parameter is not provided, the select dialog of
											the operating system opens and the further steps have to
											be proceeded manually by the user.</p>
									</li>
								</ul><p></p>
							<p>The detailed behavior of the feature depends on the app, in which the
								control is used.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p><span class="emphasis">Terminate uploading a file</span></p>
							<p>During an upload process of a file, you can terminate the upload with the
									<span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> pushbutton, for example, if the
								data file is very big and the uploading process takes too long. With
								the <code>terminationEnabled</code> property, you can decide for
								your application to make the button for termination invisible to
								prevent the user from terminating an instant upload in the
									<code>sap.m.UploadCollection</code> control.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p><span class="emphasis"><code>uploadButtonInvisible</code>
								property</span></p>
							<p>With the <code>uploadButtonInvisible</code> property, you can
								decide for your application to make the <span class="uilabel">Upload</span>
								button in the instant upload scenario invisible to prevent the user
								from uploading a file.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Layout</h2>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <span class="ph uicontrol">Rename</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>
						pushbuttons are displayed for each item and are active and visible by
						default. Both icons can be set to invisible or inactive. </p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>While most file types have generic icons (such as Word documents, Excel
						sheets and PDFs), graphic files can be displayed with a small thumbnail
						preview of its graphic if the respective URL is provided.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The toolbar of the <code>UploadCollection</code> control can be customized:</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">
							<p>To customize the toolbar, the <code>toolbar</code> aggregation can be set to the
									<code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> control which can contain
								your preferred UI5 controls. To make the position of the upload
									(<span class="ph uicontrol">+</span>) pushbutton configurable, the
									<code>sap.m.ToolbarSpacer</code> type is used. To configure
								the position of the button, you can set the placeholder element to
								the designated position.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">If the toolbar is not customized it only provides the upload
								(<span class="ph uicontrol">+</span>) button.</li>
						<li class="li">In case the customizable toolbar has been configured and the placeholder
							is missing, an exception will be thrown.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <code>mode</code> property of the <code>UploadCollection</code>
						control can be set. Therefore the <code>sap.m.ListMode</code> type is
						used.</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">
							<p>The listmode <code>Delete</code> is not supported and will be set
								to listmode <code>None</code> if used.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>In chase of an upload pending scenario, the listmode <code>MultiSelect</code> is not
								supported; in this case it will be set to listmode
									<code>None</code> automatically.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h2 class="title ">Constraints and Dependencies</h2>
			<p>By using the <code>UploadCollection</code> control, you need to be aware of the following
				constraints:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <code>UploadCollection</code> control does not work with IE9 because of a missing
						header parameter handling needed for the upload.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The file name of an upload item can contain any text and special characters
						but not a URL.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <code>sap.m.UploadCollection</code> control uses the
					<code>sap.ui.unified.FileUploader</code> control and contains dependencies
				to this control. If you want to use the <code>UploadCollection</code> control,
				you need to be aware of these dependencies. For more
					information about the <code>FileUploader</code> control, see the <a href="#/api/sap.ui.unified.FileUploader" title="#/api/sap.ui.unified.FileUploader" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.unified.FileUploader">API Reference Documentation</a>.
