				analysis path using an APF-based app, the path as well as the user who created the
				path are stored in a database table.</p><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Deletion by an Administrator</h3>
				<p>When a user left the company, the administrator deletes the user master record
					from the system. The user master record includes the personalization object
						<code>BSANLY_APF</code> (Analysis Path Framework personalization
					object). This ensures that deleting the user master record automatically also
					deletes analysis paths created by the user.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Deletion by a User</h3>
				<p>Users who still have system access can delete their own saved analysis paths directly in the
					analysis path gallery of the runtime application. To do so, open the analysis
					path menu and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>. This opens a list of all
					saved analysis paths, which can be deleted individually. Repeat this for each
					APF-based application since you can see only those analysis paths that were
					created in the application you're currently using.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Personal Data in Analysis Paths</h2>
			<p>In an APF-based application, personal data can also appear in an analysis path, for
				example, as a measure in an analysis step such as ‘revenue by consultant’. APF does
				not persist these measures, but only filter criteria that are relevant for
				selections made in a chart. When a user is deleted from the system, the personal
				data of this user is not displayed any longer in an analysis path. The filter
				criteria is also removed from the analysis path so that no personal data of the
				deleted user shows up.</p>
