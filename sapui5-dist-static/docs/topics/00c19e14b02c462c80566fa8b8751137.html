			<h2 class="title ">Filter Bar Customization</h2>
			<p>You can customize filter fields or charts that show up on the filter bar. Use the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Adapt Filters (&lt;number&gt;)</span> option in the header area
				to customize both filter modes. The filter fields in the</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">Compact filter configuration dialog box are the fields in the entity set that have
							<code>sap:filterable=”true”</code> in their metadata. Select the
						filter fields that you want to use on the filter bar.</li>
					<li class="li">Visual filter configuration dialog box are the fields in the entity set that have
							<code>sap:filterable=”true”</code> in their metadata. The fields
						need to have a <code>ValueList</code> annotation with a valid
						presentation variant qualifier.</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>In the visual filter mode, you can change the chart type, sort order, and measure according to
				your needs. Visual filter supports three basic chart types (bar, donut, and line).
				When you select a chart filter, the other chart filters are refreshed to provide the
				appropriate fields. In some cases, some of the filters selected may no longer be
				visible in the chart area. If this is the case, choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">Value
					help</span> or <span class="ph uicontrol">Selected</span> icon, to view all of the
				visual filter conditions that have been set.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>The filter selection count depends
					on the number of fields you select and is not based on the individual field
					values set within the field. The count also includes filters set from the filter
					dialog that are not seen on the filter bar.</p></div></div><p></p>

			<h2 class="title ">Filter Modes</h2>

				filter conditions are applied. When you toggle, ALP ensures that the filter values

				</ul><p></p>
			<p>Despite the prior conditions, all selections in the compact filter are included for the main
				content area, even when visual filters are used.</p>
