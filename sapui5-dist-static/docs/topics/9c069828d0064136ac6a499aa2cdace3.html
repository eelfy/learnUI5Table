		They have a name and an object with a createContent() function.</div><p>You define a simple JS fragment named <code>my.useful.UiPartX</code> as shown in the
			following code snippet:</p><section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// fragment is located in a file named: "my/useful/UiPartX.fragment.js"
sap.ui.define(["sap/m/Button"], function(Button) {
	return {
		createContent: function(oController) {
			var oButton  = new Button({
				text: "Hello World" ,
				press:oController.doSomething
			});
			return oButton;
		}
	}; 
});</pre></div></section><p>The <code>createContent()</code> function is responsible for the UI definition and
			has to return a control. The definition can be created either inline or in a separate
			file, for instance in <code>â€¦/my/useful/UiPartX.fragment.js</code>. The
				<code>oController</code> is either already defined or it is null. In the first
			case, its methods can be used for the event handlers of controls.</p><p>Despite the many similarities to views, there are also differences: First of all, there
			is no <code>getControllerName()</code> method. Fragments cannot specify whether they
			have a controller. Whether <code>oController</code> is defined or not is not a
			decision of the fragment itself. Instead, it is decided by the code instantiating the
			fragment. If that code is part of a controller, it can pass a reference to itself to the
			fragment. This means there can be a dependency between controllers and fragments:
			Fragments may expect a controller to exist and to have certain methods. And controllers
			may expect certain controls to be in the fragment. This is in line with the purpose of
			fragments - to be very light-weight re-use entities that provide little encapsulation.
			For more encapsulation, views or even components are better suited.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig">
