						asynchronous function waits 10 seconds before it times out.</p>
					<p>Here is an example of the Async check
						function:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">function(issueManager, oCoreFacade, oScope, fnResolve) {

    …
    fnResolve();

}

				<p></p></div></div><p></p><p>Additionally you need to provide or modify the JavaScript check function that
				implements the rule in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Check function</span> tab. You can
				directly test the newly added or modified rule on the already loaded page.</p><p>The newly created rule remains <cite>temporary</cite> until you submit and assign it to a
