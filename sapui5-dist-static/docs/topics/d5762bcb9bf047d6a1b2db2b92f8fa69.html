			<p></p><p>The following types of navigation targets exist:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>Navigation targets that are relevant for all analysis steps</p>
				<p>Choose this type if the navigation target is always available no matter which
					analysis steps are added to the analysis path.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Step-specific navigation targets</p>
				<p>Choose this type if the navigation target is relevant only in the context of a
					specific dimension or selection. For example, navigating to a customer fact
					sheet is useful only when a customer has been selected. A step-specific
					navigation target is displayed in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> dialog
					only if the step to which it is assigned is the active one.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>Step-specific navigation targets can be assigned to multiple analysis steps. To assign a
			previously created navigation target to an analysis step, proceed in one of the
			following ways:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>Select the navigation target and add the analysis step in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Step
						Assignments</span> field.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Select the analysis step and add the navigation target in the
						<span class="ph uicontrol">Navigation Target Assignment</span> section in the
						<span class="ph uicontrol">Step-Specific</span> field.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>You can define multiple navigation targets for each configuration. To create a navigation
			target, click <span class="ph menucascade">
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span>

			<p>At runtime, the navigation targets are displayed in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open
					In…</span> menu. Step-specific navigation targets appear at the top of the
				list. Navigation targets that are relevant for all analysis steps appear at the
				bottom of the list so that this part of the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> menu is
				stable for all steps.</p>
			<p>Navigation targets are displayed in the same order as they appear in the tree
				structure. You can change the order of the navigation targets by moving them up or
				down the tree structure using the arrow icons. </p>
			<p>The list of navigation targets in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Open In…</span> menu can be
				different from user to user. Whether a navigation target is visible for a user
				depends on the following:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>The user is authorized for the target mapping of the navigation target. This
						is the case if the user has a role to which the catalog is assigned which
						contains the target mapping.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The navigation target supports the form factor the user is currently using:
						desktop, tablet, or smartphone. This is also configured in the target
						mapping.</p>
