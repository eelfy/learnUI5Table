                                    instantiated. The analysis step gallery displays all available
                                    analysis step templates in a hierarchical select dialog. This
                                    dialog first lists all available categories. The titles of the
                                    categories as well as the order in which they are displayed are
                                    defined in the APF Configuration Modeler app. </p><p>When the user selects a category, all analysis steps available for this category are listed on
                                    the next level of the select dialog. The titles of the analysis
                                    steps are defined in the step configuration of the APF
                                    Configuration Modeler app. The step configuration also contains
                                    one or more category assignments to define the categories in
                                    which a particular step is displayed in the analysis step
                                    gallery.</p><p>On the final level, the representation types for the selected step are
                                    displayed.</p><p>When the user selects an analysis step to add it to the analysis path, the analysis step gallery calls the <span class="ph sap-technical-name">createStepAndSetActive()</span> API and adds the step to the analysis path as the active analysis step. The analysis step gallery is then closed and the <span class="ph sap-technical-name">getSteps</span> API is called to get all analysis steps in the correct sequence.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
