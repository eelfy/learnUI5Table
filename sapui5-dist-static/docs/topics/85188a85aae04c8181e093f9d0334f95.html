			(typically, a GUID) and model the fields with a semantic meaning only as non-key fields.</p><p>However, for existing databases that already
				use semantically important fields in the key and you need to be able to change them (maybe only provide them by the user upon
				creation), changing the model in such a way would lead to a data conversion with potentially high impact for customers with huge
				amounts of data.</p><p></p></div></div><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>This topic is relevant only for applications that use draft handling. For non-draft applications, as all changes are transported to the back
			end only in one shot when the object is saved, from a UI point of view, a change in a key property would just mean, that the object
			returned from the save operation is a different instance than before.</p></div></div><p>In draft applications, users cannot edit key fields because changes are merged directly
			into the draft document, and since the key field is part of the draft document's
			identifier, users would need to navigate to a different document with each merge. From
			the user experience point of view, this is not a good solution.</p><p>As a workaround, you can introduce an additional field that is editable. In an active
			document, this field's value is always identical to the key field's value. While users
			work on the draft, only the additional field is changed. Only when the draft is
			activated, is the additional field's value transferred to the key field. When activated,
			the system automatically navigates from the draft to the active instance.</p><p>On the UI, only the additional field is displayed. However, you need to use the key field
			for the navigation parameters. It should be consistent with the semantic object
			attribute.</p><p>If a user navigates to a list report or object page application, and if the navigation
			parameters are not selective enough to directly navigate to the object, you need to set
			the needed navigation parameters in the filters. As the additional field is used here,
			SAP Fiori elements need to map the value of the navigation parameter to the additional
			field. To do this, use the
