            <li class="li">
                <p>Selection Count </p>
                <p>Displays the number of selected items. The selection count is displayed only when
                    a selection is made in the active representation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Filter Information</p>
                <p>Displays a list of the filters that were set in previous analysis steps and that
                    are also applied to the active analysis step. If filter mapping has been
                    applied, you are informed about the mapped filter property. In addition, if a
                    previous step has filters that do not affect the current analysis step, you are
                    also informed about this.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Toggle Legend</p>
                <p>Shows or hides the chart legend. This option is displayed only when the user has
                    chosen a chart representation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Zoom in and zoom out (if the chart type supports zooming)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Toggle Fullscreen</p>
                <p>Displays the chart in full screen mode or returns to the original size.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Representation Type</p>
                <p>Depicts the current representation type. If the analysis step has multiple
                    representations, clicking the icon opens a dialog with the available
                    representation types for this step.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Table Representation</p>
                <p>Allows the user to display the data in a table. The related icon is displayed
                    only if an alternative table representation has been configured for the active
                    chart representation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>View Settings</p>
                <p>Allows the user to sort the table. This option is displayed only when the user
                    has chosen the table representation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p>Export to Excel</p>
                <p>You can download the data that is available on the front end to a Microsoft Excel
                    file. This feature is available in the following cases:</p><ul class="ul ">
                        <li class="li">
                            <p>When the active analysis step is a table representation</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="li">
                            <p>When you have switched to the alternative list view of any chart</p>
                        </li>

                        <code>.xlsx</code> to the download file before you can open it in
                    Microsoft Excel.</p></div></div>

            <li class="li">
                <p>Load All</p>
                <p>Loads all data records to the front end so that you don't have to page down to
                    the end of the table to ensure that all data records are loaded. This is useful,
                    for example, when you want to print or export the entire table. A counter shows
                    the number of data records that are already on the front end and the total
                    number of data records. </p>
