			<h2 class="title ">Adding Objects to a Configuration</h2>
			<p>Within a configuration, you can now start adding objects according to the following
				structure:</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loiod6135df9397948a9ac54cb7156d17068_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>The design time layout of these objects is organized as a tree structure to reflect
				the dependencies between them. For example, steps can only be added under a
				category, and representations can only be added under a step.</p>
			<p>The order in which the objects are arranged in the APF Configuration Modeler also
				determines the order in which they are displayed on the UI at runtime. In the
				analysis step gallery, the categories, for instance, are listed in the same order as
				they were designed in the APF Configuration Modeler.</p>
			<p>When you add a new object, for example, an additional step in a category, it is
				always added at the end of the list. You can use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Up</span> and
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Down</span> arrows to move an object to another position in the
				list.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Copying Objects</h2>
			<p>The following objects can be copied: </p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Configuration</li>
				<li class="li">Filters</li>
				<li class="li">Categories</li>
				<li class="li">Steps</li>
				<li class="li">Representations</li>
				<li class="li">Navigation targets</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In all cases, the object is always copied including all subordinate objects. For
				example, a category is copied including all steps and representations assigned to
				it.</p>
			<p>A copy is always added in the same place as the original object. For example, when
				you copy a configuration, the application GUID is retained so that the new
				configuration is created in the same application. The same applies to, for example,
				a step: The copy of a step is added in the same category as the original step. You
				can move the copy to a different category by changing the category assignment in the
				step itself.</p>
