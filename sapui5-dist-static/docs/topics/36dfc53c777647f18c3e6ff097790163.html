				<h3 class="title ">Deletion by an Administrator</h3>
				<p>When a user does not have access to the system any longer, for example, because
					he or she left the company, an administrator can delete the user's analysis
					paths. The analysis paths are stored in the following HANA database table:</p>
				<p>Table name: <code>"sap.hba.r.apf.core.db::ANALYSIS_PATH"</code></p>
				<p>Schema name: <code>"SAP_HBA". The user is stored in the table field "CREATED_BY_USER"</code></p>
				<p>The administrator can delete the analysis paths with an SQL statement such as the
					following:</p>
				<p><code>delete from "SAP_HBA"."sap.hba.r.apf.core.db::ANALYSIS_PATH" where "CREATED_BY_USER"
						= '&lt;user name&gt;'</code></p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Deletion by a User</h3>
				<p>Users who still have system access can delete their own saved analysis paths directly in the
					analysis path gallery of the runtime application. To do so, open the analysis
					path menu and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>. This opens a list of all
					saved analysis paths, which can be deleted individually. Repeat this for each
					APF-based application since you can see only those analysis paths that were
					created in the application you're currently using.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Personal Data in Analysis Paths</h2>
			<p>In an APF-based application, personal data can also appear in an analysis path, for
				example, as a measure in an analysis step such as ‘revenue by consultant’. APF does
				not persist these measures, but only filter criteria that are relevant for
				selections made in a chart. When a user is deleted from the system, the personal
				data of this user is not displayed any longer in an analysis path. The filter
				criteria is also removed from the analysis path so that no personal data of the
				deleted user shows up.</p>
