			<h2 class="title ">Maintenance Strategy</h2>
			<p>Every
				month, SAPUI5 releases
				a new version for productive usage:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>On SAP Business Technology Platform, all SAPUI5 versions are shipped.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>On AS ABAP, only two SAPUI5 versions per year are shipped as part of the SAP_UI
							component.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			
			<p>The release strategy follows the principle of “one innovation code line”: subsequent versions
				ensure continuous innovation with an evolving code line.</p>
			<p>Once a year, a version with long-term support is released
					and available on both SAP platforms. This SAPUI5 version is
					included in a release of the SAP_UI component, usually as part of SP02 of the
					respective SAP_UI release. All other versions do not have a maintenance
				period and no patches are provided. Required fixes are available with the next minor
				versions together with the new features. However, in exceptional cases, also the
				most recent version may be patched with correction code.</p>
			<p>For the decision
				to consume a new version, we recommend the following guideline:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>For SAP BTP, we recommend
							upgrading to the latest available SAPUI5 version, because this includes the latest capabilities, patches, and
							security fixes.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>For AS ABAP/SAP Fiori front-end server, or in case regular version updates are not
							feasible, we recommend updating to the respective long-term maintenance
							versions as outlined in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Minimal Installation
								Requirements</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">SAP Fiori Frontend
								Server</span> notes.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>For example, the following versions have a long-term
					maintenance:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>1.38, which is included in SAP_UI 7.50 and UI add-on 2.0</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>1.52, which is included in SAP_UI 7.52</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>1.60, which is included in SAP_UI 7.53</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>1.71, which is included in SAP_UI 7.54</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>

			<p>SAPUI5 resources are available on the Akamai content delivery network. There, you

			<p>OpenUI5 includes the core

        // ...
    });
});</pre></div></section><p></p>
			<p>To access the OpenUI5
				version (core version) at runtime, you use the following
