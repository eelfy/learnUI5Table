It lets you
		view both analytical data (chart format) and transactional data (table format).</div><section>
			<p>Users can interact with both the chart and the table. The initial view of the chart
				visualizes the most important aspects of the whole data set. Selecting a dimension
				within a chart area automatically filters all relevant information in the table
				area. For example, if a chart selection is Country=ABC, then all records associated
				with this country selection are filtered in the table.</p>
			<p>The <span class="ph uicontrol">Auto-hide</span> feature is displayed in the hybrid view (chart
				and table). When the feature is turned off, the table records that are not affected
				by the chart selection are also displayed in the table. If the feature is turned on,
				then only the records that are affected by the chart selection (for example, only
				the highlighted records) are displayed in the table. In this case, chart selection
				acts as an additional filter.The table records that match the selected chart context
					arehighlighted.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
