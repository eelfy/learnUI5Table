		Upload and Download Reports to Synchronize</h1><div class="shortdesc">You can upload an SAPUI5 app
		to or download it from the SAPUI5
		ABAP repository by using the SAPUI5 ABAP repository upload and download reports.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Single SAPUI5
				App</h2>
			<p>To upload, download, or delete a single SAPUI5 app, use the report
					<code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD</code>. Enter the name of the SAPUI5 app and specify
				whether you want to update, download, or delete it. You can also specify whether or
				not the line endings are adjusted automatically during the upload. In contrast to
				the ABAP team repository provider, the report does not offer a built-in code
				merge.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Uploading SAPUI5 Apps
				From an Archive</h2>
			<p>Prerequisite: The files to be uploaded are located on an HTTP web server.</p>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">To upload an SAPUI5 app from a zip or war archive, use the report
							<code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTP</code>.</li>
					<li class="li">To upload multiple SAPUI5 apps from a
						zip or war archive at once, use the report
							<code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTPN</code>.</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>Enter the relevant parameters and specify whether or not the line endings are
				adjusted automatically during the upload. You can also provide the parameters in the
				file <code>.Ui5RepositoryUploadParameters</code> located in the archive. Each
				line represents a parameter. The format is <code>&lt;parameter name&gt; = &lt;parameter value&gt;</code>.</p>
			<p>If you use SAP Business Application Studio for developing apps, we recommend that you deploy your app
				as described here: <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/Cloud/en-US/340cf0109ec6451c88f7a0129990de59.html" title="https://help.sap.com/viewer/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/Cloud/en-US/340cf0109ec6451c88f7a0129990de59.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deploy to the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository</a>.</p>
			<p> If you use the <code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTP</code> and <code>/UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD_HTTPN</code> reports to upload
				your project to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository instead, make sure that you
				upload only the content of the <code>webapp</code> or <code>dist</code> folder without the folder itself. This ensures
				that the<code> manifest.json</code> is in the root of the structure in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository and the app index can be loaded.</p>
			<p>You can also specify whether the reports run in delta or in test mode:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">Delta mode: You only want to upload the files that are new or that have been
						modified.</li>
					<li class="li">Test mode: You want to see a log file displaying what the report is
						doing.</li>
				</ul><p></p>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you use the reports, the SAPUI5 application index is
				updated automatically and any errors are displayed. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/c5e7098474274d3eb7379047ab792f1f.html" title="This index provides an indexing and caching mechanism for information related to apps, components, and libraries in the SAPUI5 ABAP repository and related to components and libraries in the SAPUI5 distribution layer." class="sap-doc">SAPUI5 Application Index</a>.</p></div></div>
			<p>The functions of the reports are also available in the RFC-enabled function module <code>/UI5/REPO_LOAD_FROM_ZIP_URL</code>. It can be
				called remotely, for example, from Maven builds. For more information, see the documentation of the reports and of the function module
					<code>/UI5/REPO_LOAD_FROM_ZIP_URL</code>.</p>
