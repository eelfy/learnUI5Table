The content is changed, for example, by uploads from development tools like SAP Business Application Studio, the available SAPUI5 repository upload and download reports, the implementation of an SAP
				Note, or manual changes using transaction <code>SE80</code> (the latter is not supported and therefore not recommended at
				all).</p><p>The execution of the report to update the index is in most cases triggered automatically. Exceptions: implementation of SAP Notes, support
				package updates, release upgrades, changes to texts in the text repository with ABAP translation tools, and manual changes using
				transaction <code>SE80</code> (not supported and therefore not recommended). In these cases, you have to trigger an update for the
				applications in question manually or schedule a calculation of the index with a reasonable time interval. Here’s an overview:</p><p>

				systems. The system automatically updates the index after transports which have been imported under certain conditions, for example,
				which version of the user interface add-on for SAP NetWeaver is installed and whether the Business Add-In (BAdI) CTS_IMPORT_FEEDBACK
				is called after an import. For more information, see SAP Note <a title="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2253480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2253480</a>.</p><p>If you are unsure whether the BAdI
				is called, you can verify this in the import log of a transport. The BAdI is called if the import log contains a <span class="ph uicontrol">Feedback
					after import or export</span> entry (there might be one after import and one after export entry) and the after import entry
				contains the following logs:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="ph uicontrol">Start: Executing method FEEDBACK_AFTER_IMPORT for business add-on CTS_IMPORT_FEEDBACK</span></p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="ph uicontrol">Scheduled index update after finished import of transports</span></p>
				</li>
			</ul><p>You can access the job <code>/UI5/APP_IDX_UPD_AFTER_IMPORT</code> that is automatically scheduled by the BAdI in transaction
					<code>SM37</code>.</p><p>Here’s how you can decide whether you need to schedule the report after transports:</p><img src="loio35e150c63be3484581ad5adc349860ad_LowRes.png" usemap="#"><p>If the import is triggered by ABAP, report
					<code>/UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE</code> is executed automatically. If the import is triggered by OS command line and the
				transport profile parameter <code>FEEDBACK_IMPORT</code> is set (see SAP Note <a title="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2253480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2253480</a>), the report is also
				executed automatically. If the transport profile parameter is not set, the report is not executed automatically.</p><p>If you have to
				schedule the report, there are three options for this:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>With a periodic time interval</p>
					<p>This is the easiest way. However, it has the small disadvantage that some time might elapse between the import of a transport
						and the start of the update depending on the interval you choose.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Starting after event <code>SAP_IMPORT_STO</code></p>
					<p>This triggers the report automatically after all transports of the import queue have been imported. However it doesn’t trigger
						the report in cases where you perform a special import of a single transport.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Schedule the report in both ways</p>
					<p>This is the most secure and fast way to ensure the index is up-to-date. The report ensures that no problems occur in cases
						where multiple executions are triggered in parallel.</p>
