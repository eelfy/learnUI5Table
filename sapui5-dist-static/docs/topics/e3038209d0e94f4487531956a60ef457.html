		keyboard and is therefore tightly connected to accessibility. Additionally, this aspect is
		coupled to the screen reader functionality.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">General Recommendations</h2>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Accessibility of UI elements</span></p>
			<p>Make sure that all available features of the application can be accessed by using only the
				keyboard - <span class="keyWrap"><kbd class="key">TAB</kbd></span>, arrows, <span class="keyWrap"><kbd class="key">ENTER</kbd></span>, and <span class="keyWrap"><kbd class="key">SPACE</kbd></span>. The user
				should be able to activate the functionality of <span class="emphasis">all</span> active
				elements.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Tab order and reading order</span></p>
			<p>The reading order of the page is very important for the application user experience. Those who
				use keyboard only should be able to navigate easily through every single element.
				You should always have in mind the fact that the page should have a logical reading
				order. This means that logically related UI controls should receive keyboard and
				reading focus in such order that preserves semantics and usability. To achieve this,
				you need to use layout controls for maintaining the correct tab order. This is
				especially important for those who use screen reader software, because in most cases
				they'll follow exactly the tab order of the application and illogical tab orders can
				confuse them. </p><div class="note other example "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

			<h2 class="title ">Tips for Testing</h2>
			<p>Start the application and put away your mouse.</p>

					<p>Can you reach every active screen element just by using the keyboard?</p>

							<p>Is this true also for dynamically created texts or control elements?

				<li class="li">
					<p>Can you navigate within control elements (for example, list, table, tabstrip) using arrow
						keys?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Can you also navigate away from each UI element using the keyboard?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Does the visible focus follow the exact keyboard commands? Is it always
						identifiable and in the visible area?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Can you execute all actions? (Compare with what you can do with the
