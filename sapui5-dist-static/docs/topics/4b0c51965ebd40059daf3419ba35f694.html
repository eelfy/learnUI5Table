		the beginning. Having more tests makes it cheaper and easier to maintain the code over time. Let's dive into the specifics using following an
		example.</div><p> </p><p>The ideal pattern for a BDD iteration goes like this: </p><ol>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Write a scenario in the feature file.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Execute the test to verify that the step definition is not found.</p>
					<p>This might seem strange since we haven't actually written a test yet, but this way we can check to see that our feature file works.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Write the step definition in the steps file.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Execute the test, see the test fail.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Develop the missing code in the app.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Execute the test and watch it pass.</p>

				<p>Here is a sample HTML bootstrap file for Gherkin. In this example, the feature file is named <code>Requirements.feature</code> and the
					steps file is named <code>Steps.js</code>. Both are located in the same directory as your HTML bootstrap. You will need to
					adjust the SAPUI5
					<code>src</code> (if you don't want to use the suggested build), SAPUI5 resourceroots, and the feature and steps file names to match
					your scenario and your
					app:</p><section class="lang-html"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

			</section><p>When you load the HTML file in your browser, the Gherkin tests are executed automatically . If you are using Google Chrome, you may
				need to start it with the command line flags<code> --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security</code>. When everything is working
				correctly, you should see something like the following in your browser:</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loiobb0e61f8e0004349bdfb37f0a4f39618_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p>We expect the test to fail because we haven't written any tests yet. You'll notice that Gherkin has explained that  it was not able to find
				a matching step definition for the first test step, "I have started the app", in the steps file. Scrolling down, you can see that none of the
				test steps have been found. We will need to write these step definitions.</p><p>Looking back at the feature file that we wrote, "I have started
				the app" is the first test step in the test scenario. Hence, it makes sense that we would see this test step first in the test results. You can
				also see the exact wording of the <code>Feature</code> and <code>Scenario</code> text that you entered: <code>Feature: Clicking
					Buttons Is a Life Saving Activity: Scenario: Click a button, save a life!</code>. This should make it easier for you to find your way
				around in the test results. </p></div></section><section class="collapsible expanded"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible expanded">Write the first failing test</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>To verify the feature file, we will implement a steps file, which to recap is both the translation that allows the computer to understand the
				human-readable feature file, and also the verification steps (tests) to be run. Once you have a working feature file and can execute the test
				suite, then you are ready to write your first test. We will start by writing a simple test that we expect to fail.</p><p>In the <code>Steps</code> file, inside the <code>init</code> method, add the following
				code:</p><section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">this.register(/^I have started the app$/i, function() {
  Opa5.assert.ok(false, 'This test will fail!');
});
</pre></div></section>The
					<code>register</code> method defines a new step definition and takes two arguments:<ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>a regular expression to match against the test steps in the feature file</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>a function to execute when there is a match </p>
					</li>
				</ul>At test execution time, the Gherkin test harness tries to find a step definition with a matching regular expression, and execute the step
				definition's test function.<p></p><p>Try executing the test now. You should see something like this:</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loiocad81d3d87ab4c4688313ecdd70ee824_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p>Step 1 is green because a matching step definition was found in the steps file. In Gherkin, the test harness always checks for the existence of
				the step definition first before executing the step definition's function. After Gherkin finds a step definition, it executes the step
				definition's function, and thus executes any QUnit assertions inside the function.</p><p>In step 2, notice how the text "This test will fail!" is copied from the steps file. You can use this functionality to make it easier to debug
				your test. We recommend that you start any QUnit assertion comment with the word <q>Verified</q> to make it easier to read your test executions.
			</p></div></section><section class="collapsible expanded"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible expanded">Write the second failing test</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>Let's write a bit more test code. To make a test useful, it will need to load your app and verify its properties. We will use OPA5 for this
				purpose. Replace the code inside your steps file's <code>init</code> method with the following
				code:</p><section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">var oOpa5 = new Opa5();

this.register(/^I have started the app$/i, function() {
  oOpa5.iStartMyAppInAFrame("Website.html");
});

this.register(/^I can see the life saving button$/i, function() {
  oOpa5.waitFor({
    id: "life-saving-button",
    success: function(oButton) {
      Opa5.assert.strictEqual(oButton.getText(), "Save a Lemming",
      "Verified that we can see the life saving button");
    }
  });
});</pre></div></section><p></p><p>You may need to adapt the above code to fit your situation. When you execute this code, you should see something like this:</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loio99af4d460e284411b91e89a17ae28815_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p>There are several important things to note here:</p><p>For one, now that you are actually testing the app, you will see a popup overlay of the
				application under test appear in the bottom right corner of the window. This overlay
				is interactive, although you should wait until the test is complete before trying to
				interact with it. The overlay is extremely helpful for debugging your tests since at
				any given point in time you can see what state the app is in, particularly when the
				debugger is running and execution is paused. If the overlay is getting in the way,
				then after the tests have finished executing you can get rid of it by selecting the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Close Frame</span> checkbox at the top left.</p><p>In the above screenshot, steps 1 and 2 are passing because Gherkin was able to match the feature file test step to a step definition in the steps
				file. The test step "I have started the app" does not actually execute any verifications (that is, it does not call any QUnit assertion
				functions) and hence there is no verification occurring between "I have started the app" and "I can see the life saving button". Step 3 is the
				actual verification of the app executed inside the step definition "I can see the life saving button" function, and since in this example the
				app is an empty Web page, the test is failing. The error message <code>Failed to wait for check</code> is an OPA5 error that happens when
				the <code>waitFor</code> function fails to find the SAPUI5 control that's being
				searched for.</p></div></section><section class="collapsible expanded"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible expanded">Write the first passing test</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>To make the "I can see the life saving button" test pass, you  need to
