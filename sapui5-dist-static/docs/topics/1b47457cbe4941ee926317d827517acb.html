			<h2 class="title ">Integration Test Setup</h2>
			<p>All integration tests are located in the <code>webapp/test/integration</code>
				folder and can be started manually by calling the
					<code>opaTests.qunit.html</code> file in the same folder or the entry
				page. Similar to the unit tests, the HTML page is a QUnit runner that calls all
				integration tests of the app and displays the test results in a readable format. It
				also might be omitted by other testrunners. There are also two namespaces defined
				for the app and the integration test folder as you have seen in the unit test
				setup.</p>
			<p>We write integration tests with OPA5 – a tool that is integrated and delivered with
				SAPUI5. It is the short name for One-Page Acceptance tests for SAPUI5. "One-Page"
				here means that OPA5 is designed for single-page Web applications, i.e. applications
				that consist only of one HTML file. OPA5 runs in the same browser window as the
				application to be tested.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>There is also a stand-alone version of OPA5 called <q>OPA</q> available that can
					be used for testing any kind of single-page Web application and that does not
					provide any SAPUI5-specific functionality. In this tutorial, <q>OPA</q> always refers to OPA5.
					It includes functionality for easily finding and matching SAPUI5 controls as
					well as their properties and aggregations.</p>

			<p>For structuring integration tests with OPA we use <q>journeys</q>. A test journey
				contains all test cases for a specific view or use case, for example the navigation
				journey simulates user interaction with the app.</p>
			<p>The journey uses another structuring element of OPA called <q>page object</q> that
				encapsulates actions and assertions needed to describe the journey. Typically those
				are related to a view in the app but there can also be stand-alone pages for
				browsers or common functionality.</p>

				</p><p>When you first start writing tests, you may find it difficult to figure out the

					a combination of matchers that match a single control. Then, all you need to do

			<p>Let’s add our first new OPA test to the <code>WorklistJourney.js</code> file.
				We describe all test cases related to the worklist logic. We can see that there is
				already a test <code>Should see the table with all posts</code> defined that
				checks if the table contains the expected number of items. There is a function
					<code>opaTest</code> that initiates a test description and receives a test
				description as the first argument as well as a callback function as the second
				argument. This format is similar to the unit test function
					<code>QUnit.test</code> except for the three arguments of the callback
				function that are specific to OPA.</p>
			<p>The three objects <code>Given</code>, <code>When</code>,
					<code>Then</code> are filled by the OPA runtime when the test is executed
				and contain the <code>arrangements</code>, <code>actions</code>, and
					<code>assertions</code> for the test. The "Given-When-Then" pattern is a
				common style for writing tests in a readable format. To describe a test case, you
				basically write a user story. Test cases in this format are easy to understand, even
				by non-technical people.</p>
			<p>Let’s give it a try with our new feature that only displays 20 posts in the table
				initially and will load more posts when we press a trigger button or scroll down.
				Here is our user story "Should see the table with all posts" and its code
					representation:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Arrangements</span></p>
						<p>Define possible initial states, e.g. the app is started, or specific data
							exists. For performance reasons, starting the app is usually done only
							in the first test case of a journey.
								<code>Given.iStartMyApp();</code></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Actions</span></p>
						<p>Define possible events triggered by a user, e.g. entering some text,
							clicking a button, navigating to another page.
								<code>When.onTheWorklistPage.iPressOnMoreData();</code></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Assertions</span></p>
						<p>Define possible verifications, e.g. do we have the correct amount of
							items displayed, does a label display the right data, is a list filled.
							At the end of the test case, the app is destroyed again. This is
							typically done only once in the last test case of the journey for
							performance reasons.
								<code>Then.onTheWorklistPage.theTableShouldHaveAllEntries
								().and.iTeardownMyApp();</code></p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>Please also note that you have to move the <code>and.iTeardownMyApp()</code>
				concatenation from the previous <code>opaTest</code> function and put it at the
				end of the last test of a journey, in this case this is our new test. For
				performance reasons, we only start and destroy the app once per journey, as it takes
				several seconds to load the app. You can concatenate actions and assertions with the
				OPA helper object and in an easily readable way. The functions will be executed one
				after another.</p>
			<p>Now you might wonder where all those descriptive functions and the helper object
					<code>onTheWorklistPage</code> are coming from. The answer is simple, the
					<code>onTheWorklistPage</code> object is a structuring element of OPA and
				inside we will implement the actions and assertions used in this test.</p>

			<p>As you can see, the OPA page object is constructed with the call
					<code>Opa5.createPageObjects</code> and a <code>configuration</code>
				object that contains the actions and assertions properties.</p>
			<p>For our test case we need to add an action <code>iPressOnMoreData</code> and an
				existing assertion <code>theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</code>. OPA tests are
				running asynchronously, so each action and assertion starts with a
					<code>waitFor</code> statement. The OPA run time will check and wait for the
				condition to be fulfilled every 400 ms by polling. If the condition is met, the
					<code>success</code> function of the configuration is called. If the
				condition is still not fulfilled after a certain amount of time (by default it is 15
				seconds but this can be configured) the test will fail.</p>
			<p>Let’s start with the action <code>iPressOnMoreData</code>. We define a
					<code>waitFor</code> statement with the current view and the table. Those
				IDs are stored as internal variables in the <code>require</code> statement above
				and are available in all tests. OPA will now try to find the table based on IDs. As
				soon as the table is available on the screen and it can be interacted with (it is
				visible, not busy,...), the <code>Press</code> action is invoked, if not, the
				error message is displayed and the test fails. When executed on a table, the
					<code>Press</code> action will simulate that a users chooses the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">More Data</span> button. </p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>The <code>Press</code> action depends on the control that it is triggered
						on and has a default behavior for most UI controls. If you, for example,
						execute <code>Press</code> on a <code>sap.m.Page</code>, this will
						trigger the <span class="ph uicontrol">Back</span> button's <code>Press</code>
						event. This behavior can be overridden by passing an ID as argument to the
						action. For
							more information, see the <a href="#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press" title="#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.test.actions.Press">API Reference:
									<code>sap.ui.test.actions.Press</code></a>.
						</p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p>The assertion <code>theTableShouldHaveAllEntries</code> is structured similarly,
				but it does not trigger an action. Here, we use the <code>success</code>
				function of <code>waitFor</code> to assert if our application is in the expected
				state. This state is defined by the matchers (in our case we expect that the list
				contains 23 items by using the <code>AggregationLengthEquals</code>. The
					<code>success</code> function does not execute the additional checks that
				are needed for triggering an action. the liste does not have to be
					<code>interactable</code> to verify that the state of the application is
				correct..</p>
			<p>With this helper object we can simply check the length of the table aggregation
					<code>items</code> to the expected number of items. We have 23 entries in
				our local mock data that we also use for this integration test. You can see that the
				number of items is actually hard-coded in the test. So only if the table has exactly
				23 items, the matcher is evaluating to <code>true</code> and the assertion is
				passed successfully. </p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>The items in our app are served from the mock server with a slight delay so
						that we can see how a real service on a backend system would behave. Even if
						we would have a real backend, we would purposely use the mock server for
						manual testing and for using them in our test cases as the test data remains
						stable and unchanged. This creates a more reliable test environment and
						easier tests. So we can write a test that checks exactly for 23 items
						here.</p>
				<p></p></div></div>Now run the <code>webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html</code>
				file and make sure that the test is failing. When our new test is invoked, OPA will
				run into a timeout because the trigger area is not found yet. You can see more
				information, if you open the developer console of your browser and check the
				messages in the console.<p></p>
