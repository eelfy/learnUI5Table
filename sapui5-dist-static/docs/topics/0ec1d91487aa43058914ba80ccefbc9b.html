			<h2 class="title ">Main Axis and Cross Axis</h2>
			<p>A FlexBox layout has a direction in which child elements are laid out. The default
				direction is <b>Row</b> and rows are laid out horizontally in reading direction.
				This defines the <b>main axis</b>. The <b>cross axis</b> in this case is
				vertical.</p>
			<p>You can change the layout direction property to <b>Column</b>, which results in a
				vertical main axis and a horizontal cross axis. This is important for the align
				properties.</p>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If browsers support vertical text flows, the direction of a row can also be
					vertical. For now this is not an issue and can be ignored.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>In addition to Row and Column, the flex direction can be set to <b>RowReverse</b> and
					<b>ColumnReverse</b> which will reverse the layout direction.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Two-Dimensional Alignment</h2>
			<p>You can determine where the flex items are aligned in a FlexBox layout. For the
				alignment you use the following two properties: <b>justifyContent</b> and
					<b>alignItems</b>. The <code>justifyContent</code> property sets the
				alignment along the main axis while <code>alignItems</code> acts on the cross
				axis.</p>
			<p>Both properties accept the values <b>Start</b>, <b>Center</b> and <b>End</b>. This
				results in nine possible combinations, for example</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><i>justifyContent = End</i> and <i>alignItems: Start</i> places the items in the
					upper right corner of a horizonzal FlexBox</li>
				<li class="li">If you set the direction property to <i>Column</i>, the main axis would be
					vertical. Combined with <i>justifyContent = End</i> and <i>alignItems:
					Start</i>, the items are placed in the lower left corner.</li>
				<li class="li">By reversing the main axis with <i>direction = ColumnReverse</i> the layout
					starts from the bottom. In this case, <i>justifyContent = End</i> refers to the
					top of the FlexBox.</li>
				<li class="li"><i>justifyContent</i> has the additional value <i>SpaceBetween</i>. This setting places the
					first and the last item at the extremes of the main axis. Any other items will
					be distributed evenly between these two.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For <i>alignItems</i> two additional values exist: <i>Baseline</i> and
				<i>Stretch</i>. <i>Baseline</i> takes the first line of text of each flex item and
				aligns their baselines. This can be useful if different font sizes are used.
					<i>Stretch</i> makes the flex items take up the whole space along the cross axis
				of the FlexBox. This is useful if all items should have the same size regardless of
				the amount of content.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Flexibility</h2>
			<p>You can let the browser handle the distribution of elements. This ensures that they
				always fill the available space along the main axis. To do this, set a flexibility
				factor on the flex items.</p>
			<p>The property to control the flexibility is called <code>growFactor</code>. It is
				set on a flex item object by means of <code>FlexItemData</code> on the
					<code>layoutData</code> aggregation. The flex layout algorithm determines
				the "natural" width of the flex items. If there is space left, this space is
				distributed among the flex items according to their relative
					<code>growFactor</code>. If, for example, a horizonzal flex container is
				300px wide and contains two elements of 100px each, 100px would remain. If the
					<code>growFactor</code> for both flex items is set to 1, both get 50px
				extra, thus making them 150px wide. If the <code>growFactor</code>  is set to 3
				for one item and to 1 for the other item, the first item gets additional 75px (¾ of
				100px) of the remaining space and the second item 25px (¼ of 100px). If the
					<code>growFactor</code> is set to its default value of 0, the item is
				inflexible and both items would keep their width of 100px.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>The flex algorithm distributes the <b>remaining</b> space, and <b>not</b> the whole space in
					the FlexBox. Therefore, the resulting widths of the items are not necessarily
					proportional to the <code>growFactor</code>.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>To achieve a proportional width according to the <code>growFactor</code>, set the width of
				all items to 0 via CSS. The sum of the "natural" widths of all items is then also 0.
				The remaining space, however, now equals the full space of the
					<code>FlexBox</code>. This space is then distributed based on the
					<code>growFactor</code>. For the example above with
					<code>growFactor</code> set to 3 and 1, setting the width of the flex items
				to 0 via CSS results in a width of 225px (¾ of 300px) for the first item and 75px (¼
				of 300px) for the second item. </p>
			<div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>Once you set a <code>growFactor</code> for any item, the flex
				layout algorithm ignores the <code>justifyContent</code> property of the FlexBox
				because the items take up all available space anyway. There would be no difference
				between the different values.</p></div></div>
