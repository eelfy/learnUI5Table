		<p>Depending on the syntax of its name, the event handler will be looked up by this name in
			different locations:</p>
		<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>Names starting with a dot ('.') are always assumed to represent a method in
						the controller. They are resolved by removing the leading dot and reading
						the property with the resulting name from the controller instance. These
						names are relative to the view/controller. For example,
							<code>press=".myLocalHandler"</code> is resolved by
							<code>attachPress(oController["myLocalHandler"],
							oController);</code></p>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>This syntax is by intention consistent to the complex binding syntax for
						formatter functions.</p></div></div>
				</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Names defined in a <code>core:require</code> statement can be used to access static
						functions of the required modules. For example, <code>press=
							"Util.handler"</code> sets the static <code>handler</code>
						function of the required <code>Util</code> module as press handler for
						the respective control. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/b11d853a8e784db6b2d210ef57b0f7d7.html" title="Modules can be required in XML views and fragments and assigned to aliases which can be used as variables in properties, event handlers, and bindings." class="sap-doc">Require Modules in XML View and Fragment</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Names containing a dot at a later position are assumed to represent:</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">
							<p>Static functions from the modules which are loaded through the XML
								view required modules (See <a href="#/topic/b11d853a8e784db6b2d210ef57b0f7d7.html" title="Modules can be required in XML views and fragments and assigned to aliases which can be used as variables in properties, event handlers, and bindings." class="sap-doc">Require Modules in XML View and Fragment</a>)</p>

						<li class="li">
							<p>Global functions if the function cannot be resolved within the XML

									<code>name press= "some.global.handler"</code> is resolved
								by calling
									<code>attachPress(ObjectPath.get("some.global.handler"),
									oController);</code>.</p>

				</p><p>When specified without parameters, the event handler will be called with one
					argument, the event object. This object can be used to retrieve the event
					parameters documented by the control’s respective event documentation.</p>
			<p></p></div></div></section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">The <code>"this"</code> Context</h2>
			
		
		<p>As long as no event handler parameters are specified and regardless of where the function was
				looked up, it will be executed with the controller as the context object
					(<code>this</code>). This is also true for global event handlers and makes
				the implementation of generic global handlers easier that may need an easy way back
				to the controller/view in which they are actually used, for example, to call
					<code>createId</code> or <code>byId</code>. This should make the
				development of global event handlers more consistent with controller local event
				handlers.</p>
		<p>Therefore, the following declaration is equivalent to a call of
				<code>controller.doSomething()</code> when the button is pressed:</p>
		<section class="lang-xml"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething"/&gt;
</pre></div></section></section><p>However, once event parameters are specified using the syntax described below, the
				<code>this</code> context is always the object on which the handler function is
			defined. For controller methods, the controller remains the <code>this</code>
			context, but for methods defined in the XML view required modules or on global objects,
			that owner object is used as <code>this</code> context. In case the controller is
			still required in such global handler functions, it can be explicitly passed as
				<code>$controller</code> parameter (see the <span class="ph uicontrol">Passing
				Parameters</span> section below). Functions defined directly on the XML view
			required modules or on the <code>window</code> object have an undefined
				<code>this</code> context.</p><p>By invoking the special JavaScript function .<code>call(...)</code> on your event
			handler function, you can also provide a different <code>this</code> context. For
			example, you can still have the controller as <code>this</code> in an event handler
			in a global helper object, even when you pass parameters, by doing:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button core:require="{Helper:'path/to/Helper'}" text="Press Me" press="Helper.doSomething.call($controller, 'Hello World')"/&gt;</pre></div></section><section id="section_qzw_5bm_ndb">
			<h2 class="title ">Passing Parameters</h2>
			<p>In XMLViews and JSONViews it is also possible to directly specify the parameters that
				should be passed into the event handler function. These parameters then are passed
				instead of the event object. The syntax mimics the JavaScript syntax for function
				calls:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">'Hello World'</span>)"/&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Any JavaScript literals including objects and arrays can be passed:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething('string', 0, 5.5, {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}, ['value1', 'value2'])"/&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>It is also possible to access model properties. The syntax to be used is the one used
				within Expression Binding – binding paths are enclosed in <span class="emphasis">${…}</span>
				:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">${products&gt;unitPrice}</span>)"/&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>The binding context from which relative binding paths are resolved is the context of
				the control which triggers the event. This means that for a control in a table row,
				relative binding paths like the one above, always pass the data from the table row
				where the event occurred. This is very convenient, because it is no longer required
				to find out the data element to which the table row is bound.</p>
			<p>Complex binding syntax can also be used (to add formatters, types etc.), as well as
				all expressions allowed by <a href="#/topic/daf6852a04b44d118963968a1239d2c0.html" title="Expression binding is an enhancement of the SAPUI5 binding syntax, which allows for providing expressions instead of custom formatter functions." class="sap-doc">Expression Binding</a>:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">${path: 'products&gt;unitPrice', formatter: '.formatPrice'}</span>)" /&gt;
&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">10 * ${products&gt;unitPrice}</span>)" /&gt;
&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">${products&gt;type} === 'Laptop'</span>)" /&gt;
</pre></div></section>

				</p><p>Even though complex bindings can have multiple parts (use multiple data
					properties) instead of just one data property path, this is not possible for the
					event parameters. Therefore, you cannot use <code>parts</code> in
					bindings.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>Formatters are resolved the same way as the event handlers: a leading dot means the
				formatter is member of the controller.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>While it seems like regular JavaScript can be written directly in the event
					handler specification, this is not the case. The entire expression is evaluated
					as expression binding and only the syntax elements allowed there can be
					used.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>There are two special named models available in event handlers to make accessing
				certain values easier:</p>
			<p>The first one is named <code>$parameters</code> and contains the event
				parameters:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Select change=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">${$parameters&gt;/selectedItem}</span>)" /&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Here the event parameter <span class="parmname">selectedItem</span> is passed into the event
				handler.</p>
			<p>The other one is named <code>$source</code> and is a
					<code>ManagedObjectModel</code> which wraps the control firing the
				event:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething(<span class="emphasis">${$source&gt;/text}</span>)" /&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Here the text of the pressed button is passed into the event handler.</p>
			<p>There are also two special values which can be used as parameters.</p>
			<p>The first special value is named <code>$event</code> and represents the original
				event object. This event object is no longer passed to event handlers, once
				parameters are specified. This is because of the <code>$parameters</code> model,
				which provides access to the event parameters, and it is not needed in most cases.
				However, when access to the event object is still needed in the event handler, it
				can be explicitly passed:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething<span class="emphasis">($event)</span>" /&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>This leads to the same result as specifying <code>.doSomething</code> without any
				parameters, but further parameters can of course be given.</p>
			<p>The second special value is <code>$controller</code>. As described above, as soon
				as parameters are specified, the <code>this</code> context inside the event
				handler function is always the object on which this function is defined. However,
				sometimes it is still required to access the controller even in a handler function
				which is NOT defined in the controller, but on some other helper object. In this
				case, the controller can be explicitly passed as one of the parameters:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething<span class="emphasis">($controller)</span>" /&gt;</pre></div></section>
