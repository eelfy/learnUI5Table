		works.</div><p><img src="loiofba9b381e3a94d87a4fc4fd956b53799_LowRes.png" alt="The graphic is explained in the following" usemap="#"></p><p>The original app displays the fields <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> and
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Type</span>.</p><p>Using SAPUI5 flexibility, customer 1 adds the additional field
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Info</span> and customer 2 renames the existing field <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">Car</span>.
			After the app was shipped to the customers, SAP changes <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span> in the
			original app.</p><p>Applying the changes based on the layering concept, the customers would now get the
			following:</p><p>
			</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>In the app of customer 1, <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> would be replaced by
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span>. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Info</span> field
						added by the customer would also be applied.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>In the app of customer 2, the change made by SAP (<span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> renamed to
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span>) would not be applied. Reason:
						customer 2 renamed this field to <span class="ph uicontrol">Car</span> and changes made
						by customers overrule changes made by SAP.</p>
				</li>
