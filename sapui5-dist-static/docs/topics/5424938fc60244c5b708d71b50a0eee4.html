		the target texts.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">What's the recommended translation approach?</h2>
			<p>The recommended translation approach is to store your target texts in properties files
				(resource bundles), a <code>&lt;identifier&gt;_&lt;locale&gt;.properties</code>
				file for every language the app is translated to (&lt;locale&gt; containing the
				language and an optional country code). For example,
					<code>i18n_en_US.properties</code> would contain the American English texts
				of the <code>i18n.properties</code> source file. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/91f225ce6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="A resource bundle file is a Java properties file (as described in the Javadoc of class java.util.Properties). It contains key-value pairs where the values are the language-dependent texts and the keys are language-independent and used by the application to identify and access the corresponding values." class="sap-doc">Resource Bundles</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">When can I use the SAPUI5 text
				repository?</h2>
			<p>You can use the SAPUI5 text
				repository as a fallback if you cannot use the recommended approach. Please only use
				it in this case.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">What's the fallback all about?</h2>
			<p>When you use the SAPUI5 text
				repository, the source texts are stored in the default properties file
					<code>&lt;identifier&gt;.properties</code> (that is, there are not <i>n</i>
				properties files as with the recommended approach). The SAPUI5 text repository writes
				the texts that are stored in the default properties file to a language-dependent
				database table. As usual, the texts can then be translated using transaction
					<code>SE63</code> (usually in a separate system). The master language of the
					SAPUI5 ABAP repository
				is taken as the master language for the submitted texts. Once the translated texts
				are transported back to the respective systems, they can be accessed at runtime when
				texts in a certain language are requested.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">What do I have to do to use the SAPUI5 text
				repository?</h2>
			<p>You have to set up the default properties file in a special way by adding the following key as
				the first line in the properties file with texts that you submit to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository:</p>
			<p><code># SAPUI5 TRANSLATION-KEY &lt;GUID with 32 characters&gt;</code></p>
			<p>You can create the GUID with the ABAP function module <code>GUID_CREATE</code>,
				or you can create the complete line with the ABAP report
					<code>/UI5/TEXT_FILE_GEN_TRANS_KEY</code>. (A UUID as used in Java is also
				supported.)</p>
			<div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>The GUID serves as a unique identifier for the properties file. Never change the
					GUID or copy it to other properties files.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>The properties file has to fulfill the following rules:</p>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">It doesn't contain any duplicate text elements.</li>
					<li class="li">The text must be on one line and can have a maximum of 255 characters.</li>
					<li class="li">A text type is assigned to every text element.</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>Accidental overwriting of texts in the SAPUI5 text repository with
				texts from other properties files is prevented. If a duplicate GUID is detected, the
				properties files cannot be synchronized. It's not possible to rename or relocate a
				properties file and to submit it once it's contained in the SAPUI5 text repository.
				Before you can rename or relocate a properties file, you have to remove the texts
				from the SAPUI5 text
				repository by using the report <code>/UI5/TEXT_ENTRIES_DELETE</code>.</p>
			<div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If you run this report, all translated texts get lost. Therefore, only use it for
					texts that are not yet translated.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>After running the report, submit the renamed or relocated properties file again.</p>
			<p>If you reassign the BSP application on the ABAP server (representing a single SAPUI5 repository) from a
				local (<code>$TMP</code>) package to a non-local package, you also need to
				resubmit the properties file. All text elements are generated again with the new
				creation time stamp.</p>
			<p>
				</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>Since the master language of the SAPUI5 ABAP
						repository serves as the master language of the texts, it's important that
						you use the same language for the creation of the repository that was used
						for the properties files. When you use the SAPUI5 repository
						team provider and create the BSP application manually, you have to choose
						the correct language on the logon screen.</p>
