		to the correctness of the resulting HTML. Some vital accessibility features (screen reader
		and keyboard support) rely on a correct and meaningful structure of the
		application.</div><section><h2 class="title ">Rules and Guidelines</h2><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Don't change the HTML</h3>
				<p>Theming (CSS selectors), keyboard handling (tab order) and screen reader support
					are tightly coupled with the HTML structure of the generated pages. If you
					change the structure of the elements (for example, from custom JavaScript, HTML
					or CSS), this could break some or all of the accessibility aspects. In addition,
					it makes debugging the application more difficult.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Check the focus persistence</h3>
				<p>When opening or closing a dialog or navigating between pages, the focus should stay on the
					same control as it was on before opening or navigating. If the control no longer
					exists, the focus should be put on its parent (for example, if the control was
					inside an action sheet, set the focus on the button which opened the action
					sheet). </p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>When the parent control cannot receive focus or is no longer available,
							the focus should go to a control nearby.</p>
					<p></p></div></div><p></p>
				<p>For more information, see <a href="#/api/sap.ui.core.Element/methods/focus" title="#/api/sap.ui.core.Element/methods/focus" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.core.Element/methods/focus">sap.ui.core.Element/methods/focus</a> API documentation in the Demo
					Kit.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Initial focus position</h3>
				<p>Within an application, the initial focus should be placed on the element that is most likely to be edited or interacted with first (for
					example, mandatory fields on a form). </p>
				<p>When opening dialogs or new pages, the focus should be on the first focusable
					element inside the content area.</p>
				<div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>On touch devices, if the first focusable element is a control that would open
						the soft keyboard, it is better to place the focus elsewhere - on the footer
						of the dialog or on a control that requires no keyboard input.</p>
					<p>A good practice is to set the focus on the first mandatory element. </p>
				<p></p></div></div>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Don't interfere with existing accessibility
					features</h3>
				<p>Overriding code, for example the keyboard tab order or SAPUI5 key handlers, will impact the correct
					handling and may break the accessibility of the whole application.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Make sure that each component has a unique ID</h3>
				<p>The SAPUI5 framework handles the
					creation of unique IDs automatically. If you pass IDs yourself, make sure that
					they are unique within the whole application. For more information, see the
						<cite>Related Information</cite> section. </p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Provide meaningful tooltips for icons, icon buttons and where
					otherwise appropriate</h3>
				<p>Provide a text alternative for non-text elements and the necessary additional
					information, in case the text space is insufficient. You should use a tooltip as
					a label for unlabeled elements only. Additionally, a
						<code>Placeholder</code> can be used as a label if it is not a
					formatting hint.</p>

			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Tooltips for container controls</h3>
				<p>Container and layout controls such as <code>VerticalLayout</code> or
						<code>Grid</code> inherit the tooltip property from
						<code>sap.ui.core.Element</code>. </p><div class="note tip  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>We do not recommend setting a tooltip for the whole layout control, as it
							will not be displayed. You can set the needed tooltips for the
							individual controls which the container holds. </p>

					Tip
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If you are developing your own controls, follow the guidelines listed under
						<cite>Related Information</cite>.</p>
			<p></p></div></div></section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Tips for Testing</h2>
			<p>Start the application and check each screen element. Check the following:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Does it have a label or a tooltip (hover with the mouse)? </p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Are the labels and tooltips (fully) visible, clear, accurate, and
								meaningful?</p><ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for each input field or for a sequence of
										input fields? (For example: street and number)?</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for buttons, icons and images?</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p>Is this also true for grouped information?</p>
								</li>
							</ul><p></p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Is the user informed about the required entries and input?</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
