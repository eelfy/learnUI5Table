		Elements</h1><div class="shortdesc">This section contains information about developing SAP Fiori apps using SAP Fiori
		elements.</div><p>SAP Fiori elements provide designs for UI patterns and predefined templates for common
			application use cases. App developers can use SAP Fiori elements to create SAP Fiori
			applications based on OData services and annotations that don't need JavaScript UI
			coding. The resulting app uses predefined views and controllers that are provided
			centrally. This means no application-specific view instances are required. The SAPUI5 runtime interprets
			metadata and annotations of the underlying OData service and uses the corresponding
			views for the SAP Fiori app at startup.</p><p><span class="emphasis">Why use SAP Fiori elements?</span></p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>High <span class="emphasis">development efficiency</span> to cover what 80% of all
						apps need</p>
					<p>You do not need to build the UI over and over again. Just reuse the common
						features required by most applications. They are provided by the SAP Fiori
						elements floorplans.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Design consistency</span></p>
					<p>Predefined floorplans, views, and controllers ensure UI consistency within
						and across similar apps. Apps created using SAP Fiori elements are kept
						up-to-date as they are automatically adapted to the most recent design
						guidelines.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li"><p><span class="emphasis">Decoupling of UI and business logic</span></p>The
					metadata-driven development model uses semantic annotations and significantly
					reduces the amount of front-end code. Developers can focus on the business
					logic.</li>

			</p><p>The initial effort for creating an app using SAP Fiori elements might be higher than
				creating a freestyle SAP Fiori app. However, you will be richly rewarded for this
				effort after you've created more apps this way because your apps will benefit from
				using the framework and the included features, as described below. </p>
		<p></p></div></div><p>You can create apps using the following SAP Fiori elements floorplans:</p><ul class="ul ">

					<p>SAP Fiori elements contain predefined templates for list reports and object
						pages. A list report lets users filter, view, and work with items (objects)
						organized in list (table) format. The list report is typically used in
						conjunction with an object page. This object page lets users work with
						objects, providing functions for viewing, editing, and creating objects.</p>

					<p>A worklist displays a collection of items to be processed by the user. There
						is no need for sophisticated filtering. Working through the item list
						usually involves reviewing details of the list items and taking action. In
						most cases, the user has to either complete a work item or delegate it.</p>

						data-driven SAP Fiori app for organizing large amounts of information.
						Information is visualized in a card format in an attractive and efficient
						way. Different cards are used for different types of content. The
						user-friendly experience makes viewing, filtering, and acting on data quick
						and easy. While presenting the big picture, business users can focus on the
						most important tasks enabling faster decision making as well as immediate
						action.</p></li>
