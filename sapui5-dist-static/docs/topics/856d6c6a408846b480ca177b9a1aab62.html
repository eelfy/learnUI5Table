Components or views can serve as dynamic targets.</div><p>Usually, routing targets (that represent views or components) are defined statically in the <a href="#/topic/902313063d6f45aeaa3388cc4c13c34e.html" title="Routing configuration consists of routes, targets, config, and owner." class="sap-doc">Routing Configuration</a>
			inside the <code>manifest.json</code> file. But there are more and more scenarios where a target can't be defined during design time
			because the necessary information is only available at runtime. This could apply, for example, to a routing target that depends on the
			user configuration and must be loaded from the back end at runtime.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

			</p><p> Defining the targets statically in the <code>manifest.json</code> file is the preferred solution, as this allows for optimization
				possibilities (e.g. during build time). Only make use of dynamic targets when a static declaration is not possible, e.g. because
				certain information is not available during design time. </p>
		<p></p></div></div><p>Before a target can be displayed, it needs to be added to the router. The SAPUI5 routing provides APIs to let an application add routing targets dynamically and to display them.</p><section id="section_jnj_rgx_mjb">

			<h2 class="title ">Displaying Dynamic Targets</h2>
			<p> After a target has been added, it is possible to display it with the
						<a href="#/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Targets/methods/display" title="#/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Targets/methods/display" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.core.routing.Targets/methods/display">display</a> method of the <code>sap.ui.core.routing.Targets</code> module.</p>
			<p>A typical use case is to display a dynamic target after navigating to a route. By default there is no connection between a dynamically added
				target and the matched route, which would be relevant for the life-cycle of targets and the handling of the browser hash. In this
				case, the target will not be suspended after navigating away from the corresponding route, and the hash of the router will be
				reset.</p>
			<p>However, if it's relevant to keep the hash in the router and make the target suspended after navigating away, the information about the target
				being connected to the matched route needs to be provided. In such a case, it is necessary to provide the
					<code>routeRelevant</code> parameter to the <code>display</code> method with its value set to <code>true</code>.</p>
			<p>After defining a target as <span class="emphasis">route-relevant</span>, a connection between the active route and the target is created.
				Navigating away from the route will remove the dynamic target, so that the dynamic target won't be displayed automatically once the
				same route is matched again. To display the dynamic target once the route is matched again, the <code>display</code> method needs
				to be called again.</p>
