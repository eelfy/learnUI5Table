			</ul>
		<p></p><p>On the SAP Gateway front-end
			server, you can find SAP-specific vocabularies in the SAP Gateway Service Builder
			(transaction <code>SEGW</code>) under <span class="ph menucascade">
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Extras</span>
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Vocabulary Repository</span>
			</span>.</p><p>The following types of vocabulary-based annotations are available:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>In-place: These are part of the service's metadata document.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Ex-place: These are composed of an Annotation Provider Class (APC) outside the metadata
						document. The APC is bound to the service using a registration in
						transaction <code>/IWBEP/REG_VOCAN</code>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul><p></p><p>These annotations are available using a query to the SAP Gateway catalog service,
				<code> /sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/</code>. Entity Set:
			‚Annotations‘.</p><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Reusability</h2>
			<p>If the OData service is editable instead of read-only, add annotation elements as needed to
				activate or control the draft infrastructure. Existing read-only OData services that
				are annotated, such as fact sheets, can be reused for the list report and object
				page templates under these circumstances:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>The annotations have to be stored in the back-end system. They also need
							to have the life cycle of the data model in the back-end system. Note
							that facet texts need to be defined in a front-end file after
							generation.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The OData service models (entity sets and entity types) are derived from
							CDS views. The CDS entities are the primary artifacts for the data
							model. The transactional runtime model (based on the BOPF) is generated
							based on annotations.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">The UI annotations are attached to CDS views using the tags as defined in the SAP - ABAP
						Programming Model for SAP Fiori guide in the documentation for your SAP
						NetWeaver version on SAP Help Portal at <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER" title="https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER</a>.</li>
					<li class="li">In the front end, CDS UI annotations are exposed generically and dynamically
						through SAP Gateway
						APIs (APC) as OData Version 4.0 annotation documents that can be addressed
						separately.</li>
				</ul><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Although you can use any annotation source, we recommend using CDS
							annotations in metadata extensions and exposing them using SAP Gateway and
							SADL. The exposure generates OData annotations (XML format) from the CDS
							annotations. The following sections explain which OData annotation
							controls each UI element. </p>

			<h2 class="title ">Actions</h2>
			<p>General actions are available for draft-enabled documents (edit, save, cancel/discard). You
				can also define additional actions using annotations.</p>
			<p>The draft-handling actions are handled by the Business Object Processing Framework (BOPF).
				However, you must back up the application-specific actions using an implementation
				in the OData service. For general information about actions and how to set them up,
				see <a href="#/topic/cbf16c599f2d4b8796e3702f7d4aae6c.html" title="You can use generic actions provided by SAP Fiori elements and implement application-specific actions using annotations or extension points." class="sap-doc">Actions</a>.</p>
			<p>Each action corresponds to an OData function import.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Field Control</h2>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>This is relevant only for list report and object pages, worklists, and analytical list pages. </p><p>Field controls are omitted from the list
					report page since it is a read-only page. In a list report page, field controls are considered only if there are custom actions
					that reference field controls.</p><p></p></div></div>
			<p>You can use field controls to display a UI field as mandatory or read-only, and to hide the
				field. Field control information is partly static information and valid for all
				business document instances. However, most use cases are dynamic and reflect the
				state of the UI application, business document, or user context and must be
				controlled by the business logic.</p>
			<p>As business logic is implemented in the OData service, the OData service also has to
				provide the relevant field control information. This is valid for the static
				information the service metadata contains, as well as for dynamic information that
				is part of the entity data. There is a specification for an SAP extension of the
				OData protocol based on annotations for OData Version 2.0 that also covers field
				control. For more information, see <a href="http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-44986" title="http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-44986" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Annotations for
					OData Version 2.0</a>.</p>
			<p>The controls interpret and apply field control information automatically provided by the OData
				service. When using a smart field, binding the control’s
					<code>value-Property</code> to a property in the OData model to achieve
				field control as defined by the OData service is sufficient. Field control of the
				OData service may be overruled by setting more restrictive properties for the smart
				field.</p>
