		security.</div><p>Security on the client and server side is not sufficient if the data transport between client and
			server can be read, intercepted, or even modified by an attacker. Per default, HTTP
			communication is stateless and unencrypted and this makes it necessary to configure it
			in a way that it uses encrypted connections and to add session handling on top using
			either cookies or URL rewriting. </p><section id="section_745F982F3B5047529CC3C89AA359B4AF"> 
		<h2 class="title ">Encryption</h2> 
		<p>Sending the HTTP protocol over a SSL secured connection is not only standardized, but also
				required for SAP applications.</p> 
				<p>SAPUI5 fully supports the use of
				HTTPS, but there are some restrictions regarding the CDN version of SAPUI5 when HTTPS is
				used. It is recommended to enable or at least to test SSL connections in an early
				stage of application development, as usually switching to HTTPS causes some issues.
				When the application is started using HTTPS, the SAPUI5 library also has
				to be loaded from an HTTPS server.</p>

		<h2 class="title ">Session Security</h2> 
		<p>Even if the data transport is secured using SSL or TLS, there are possibilities to hijack such
				a secure connection and send malicious requests from the client. Cross-site request
				forgery and session fixation are two of the prominent examples of this class of
				attacks. </p> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 does only provide XSRF prevention for the
	 		data, which is sent to the server by SAPUI5. Currently this only happens in the
		  OData Model, where a XSRF token is read from the server and used for subsequent
		  write requests. 
		</p> 
		<p>The application is responsible for using the XSRF header or other mechanisms to prevent XSRF
				for all other server communication triggered by the application. </p>
