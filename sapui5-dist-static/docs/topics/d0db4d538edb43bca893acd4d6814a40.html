				control?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>While there is always the option to create a new theme, this is
				overkill for most minor style adaptations. For those minor changes, the
				recommendation is to include additional CSS into the page which changes the style of
				the respective tags of the SAPUI5 control. This
				allows complete, arbitrary changes of the visual design - after all it is the same
				technology that the UI5 controls use for their styling.</p><p> The main options are
				the following:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Inspect the HTML and CSS of a control and write a similar, but adapted CSS rule
					for a CSS property you want to override for all controls of a type.</li>
				<li class="li">Call <code>.addStyleClass("myStyle")</code> on some control instances if you
					want only those instances to look different from other instances - and then
					write CSS code that refers to the normal classes/tags and to the CSS class you
					just added.</li>
			</ul><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					
					<li class="li">With this high degree of power and flexibility comes quite some
						responsibility. With CSS you can easily break the functionality of a
						control. This is not SAPUI5-specific, but when you make CSS adaptions, you should always have good
						knowledge of this open standard.</li>
					<li class="li">The inner structure of a control, the tag hierarchy, the IDs and CSS classes
						are <span class="emphasis">not</span> part of the public control API for which we
						guarantee stability. This is also the case for other UI libraries which
						might define some CSS classes as stable, but not everything else. As CSS can
						refer to the inner structures of a control, you have
						to
						accept the risk that your style changes break when
						we
						change the inner structure. Changing the inner structure
						is
						a freedom we absolutely need to reserve, so we can fix
						bugs and add features of a
						control.</li>
					<li class="li">When your CSS does not work as expected, use the developer tools in your
						browser to inspect the page and check which CSS rules are applied to the
						respective tag, and which rules might be applied but are overridden by other
						rules. If your rules are overridden by other rules, this is probably due to
						their order of appearance (last rule wins) or the CSS selector specificity
						(more specific CSS selectors win). </li>
				</ul>
			<p></p></div></div><b>DON'Ts</b><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Do not adapt the style attribute of HTML elements belonging to SAPUI5 controls.
					When these controls are re-rendered, the changes will be lost.</li>
			</ul></div></section><section id="section_mwg_rvd_nbb" class="collapsible"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible">How can I provide additional CSS that is not overwritten by the SAPUI5 CSS?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>When SAPUI5 is used in a standard way, which means loaded by
					a<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a page, and all libraries declared in the
				respective attribute of the <code>script</code> tag), it is sufficient to just add the custom CSS to any place after the SAPUI5
				<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. SAPUI5 will insert its CSS links
				immediately after the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, so any subsequent CSS will appear further down in the DOM and can thus
				overwrite the SAPUI5 CSS.</p><p>However, it is important to understand
				the precedence rules of CSS: The order of
				appearance
				is not the only factor that determines which one of two or more conflicting rules wins. Actually it is only the least important
				factor. The most important (and maybe least known) factor is the specificity of the selector belonging to a rule.</p><p> For example,
				if one rule says <code>button {color:red;}</code> to make all button texts red, and a second rule says <code>div &gt; button
					{color:green;}</code> to make all button texts, which are direct children of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, green, the
				second rule always wins because it is more specific. The order of appearance in the DOM does not matter in this case. It would only
				matter if both rules started with an equal selector, such as <code>button{color:***}</code>.</p><p> The order of loading is
				completely irrelevant, only the position in the DOM counts in this case. If you load SAPUI5 without a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the
					<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, or if you do not specify all used control libraries in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, but
				loaded some of them later on when the body was already loaded, you can still make sure a custom CSS appears further down in the DOM by
				loading it with <code>sap.ui.dom.includeStyleSheet(stylesheetUrl[, id])</code><span class="emphasis">after</span> loading SAPUI5 or the dynamically loaded control
					library.</p><section><span class="emphasis">Related Information</span><ul class="ul ">

				controls not have a <code>style</code> property where I can make arbitrary
				changes?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>A control usually does not map to <span class="emphasis">one</span> HTML element, but to a
				whole tree of HTML elements. Whatever is set for the <code>style</code> property
				would probably be added to the root element of this HTML tree, and only there, so
				there is no <code>style</code> access to inner parts. If you just want to
				override the height of a button, this would actually work. But as soon as a change
				is a bit more complex, it will not work that easily. A more complex change is, for
				example, adapting the height of a <code>ComboBox</code> control. The outer
					<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will get the proper height. And incidentally also
				the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag inside, as it has 100% height set. But the
				dropdown arrow and the respective button-kind-of-thing has a fixed height, and the
				whole control will look pretty broken then.</p><p>In other cases, when HTML elements that break the CSS inheritance chain are nested,
				for example, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and font settings, you can change
					<code>style</code> to a different font and text color, but it will simply do
				nothing.</p><p>In general, we try to expose the obvious adaptation content in the API, for example,
				the button height. But the less obvious adaptations might have to be supported from
				inside the control to work properly, and
				as
				we cannot foresee and support everything you can do with a <code>style</code>
				property, we raise the bar a little bit by requiring you to write
				CSS (potentially using <code>.addStyleClass(…)</code> for the respective
				control). With CSS you can do what you cannot do with a <code>style</code>
				property: tweak the inner HTML components of a control.</p><p>Applications (at least the more traditional ones – currently this seems to be less of
				a rule, but I’m not sure it will stay like this forever) need to conform to some
				visual design guideline and, in general, it is not even desired that applications
				change the <code>TextField</code> height or use font just the way they like. As
				you can use CSS, UI5 still supports that, but we shouldn’t make breaking the visual
				design a rule in our official API.</p></div></section><section class="collapsible"><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><h2 class="title collapsible">I am adding a style class, but it does not work! Why?</h2></div><div class="fig"><p>If you want to change some styling and use <code>control.addStyleClass(…)</code>
				to add a CSS class, but it does not seem to work, you first have to pin down exactly
				what is not working:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Has the style class not been added to the HTML?</li>
				<li class="li">Has the style class been added correctly, but the style you supplied not been
					applied by the browser?</li>
			</ul><p>You can check this by inspecting the HTML with your browser's developer tools.</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">If the style class has really not been added to a control, bear in mind that some entities
					are not controls, but only elements (inherited from
						<code>sap.ui.core.Element</code>). Only some of them support
						<code>addStyleClass</code>.</li>
				<li class="li">If the style class is available in the HTML, the bug is inside the CSS styles
					you supplied: <ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">Are they loaded by the browser?</li>
						<li class="li">Are the selectors matching the element you want to style? You can again
							check in the developer tools: They mostly list all styles which apply,
							but some are overriding others (those are usually listed with a
							strikethrough). If your style is not listed at all, your CSS selector is
							probably not correct.</li>
						<li class="li">If your selector is fine, but other style rules override your styles (potentially those
							from the original UI5 theme), then the CSS precedence rules determined
							this. Refer to the section on additional CSS above and see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#cascading-order</a> for

							on specificity.</li>
						<li class="li">Maybe your browser does not understand the CSS styles you have written.
							Some browsers still display them in the developer tools, some don't, so
							you might want to try changing very common styles like the border to
							check whether selector and specificity are fine.</li>
