			<li class="li">
				<p>Control name</p>
				<p>The control name is a string that consists of the library name and the control name, separated by a dot. The library name can be omitted if
					there is no need to assign the control to a library. It is possible, for example, to use <span class="cmdname">Square</span> as control name. For
					controls that are reused by others, we recommend to use a unique library name, for example <span class="cmdname">sap.byd.Square</span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Control metadata</p>
				<p>The metadata defines the properties, events, aggregations and associations of a control.</p>
				<p>Control properties, such as text or width, are used to modify the appearance or to relate to data that is displayed by the control. The
					controls are defined by the control metadata, which is the public API of the control. The API can be used by applications at runtime and
					also contains information on runtime features such as data binding and type validation checks.</p>
				<p>Controls can aggregate other controls. These controls with aggregations serve as a container or layout control to which the application can
					add child controls. They can also serve as composite controls if the control itself adds child controls and reuses available components. In
					an aggregation, child controls are owned by the parent control and are destroyed together with the parent control. A control can only have
					one aggregation parent. Adding the control to another aggregation removes it from the previous parent control.</p>
				<p>Associated controls are not part or children of an aggregation control. They are connected by ID instead of reference. Destroying a control
					in an association does not affect the other control. It is possible that an associated control does not yet or no longer exist.</p>
				<p>Controls fire events. Events typically relate to the control's purpose and functionality on a semantically higher level than browser events
					such as <span class="cmdname">click</span>. Examples for control events are <span class="cmdname">triggerSearch</span> for a search field or
						<span class="cmdname">collapse</span> in a panel.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Elements</p>
				<p>Elements are parts of controls or rather configuration packages for parts of controls.
					Elements <span class="emphasis">cannot </span> be used standalone and do <b>not</b> have
					their own renderer. Instead, the control that uses the element does the
					rendering: The <span class="cmdname">ComboBox</span> control, for example, renders the
						<span class="cmdname">Item</span> elements. The information provided for controls also
					applies to elements but not to the renderer. The
						<code>sap.ui.core.Element</code> class is the base class of
						<code>sap.ui.core.Control</code>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Methods</p>
				<p>By convention, methods are public, unless their name starts with an underscore or if it is one of the special method types. When developing
					control libraries, public methods must be annotated with <code>@public</code> in the JSDoc, and private methods with
						<code>@private</code>. The generated getter/setter methods for properties are also public methods.</p>
				<p>Methods are added to a new control by simply providing the implementation. It is not necessary to add the method to the metadata. Other
					controls and the application must only call public methods and the control ensures that they remain compatible. There are no technical rules
					that prevent the call of private methods, but it is not allowed.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>The base class for all controls in SAPUI5 is <code>sap.ui.core.Control</code>. To
			inherit and extend the functionality, specific controls can either inherit from the base class, or from another control.</p><section>
			<h2 class="title ">UI Control Constructors</h2>
			<p>A constructor is a special type of function that is called to create an object. The constructor uses values to set control properties, thus
				preparing the new object for use.</p>
			<p>In SAPUI5, control constructors accept the following arguments in the specified
				order:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="li">An optional unique identifier of type <code>string</code> which must either be the first argument, or omitted altogether. If you omit
					the ID, the SAPUI5 framework automatically computes an ID. Specifying your own
					identifier allows your application to easily find the control and, for example, retrieve the current user input from it. Alternatively, you
					can keep a reference to the control in a variable.</li>
				<li class="li">A simple object as <code>mSettings</code> parameter that defines values for any
					property, aggregation, association, or event.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following code snippet shows an example of a constructor that is called to create a new text control saying "Hello World" with the specified
				tooltip and width:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// required from sap/m/Text
var oText = new Text("testText",
{text : "Hello World", tooltip: "This is an example tooltip", width: "100px"});</pre></div></section>
			<p>The above example is an abbreviated version of the following code snippet with a detailed list of statements, which is alternatively
				supported:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// required from sap/m/Text
var oText = new Text("testText"); 
oText.setText("Hello World");
oText.setTooltip("This is an example tooltip");
oText.setWidth("100px");</pre></div></section>
			<p>The supported parameters are documented in the <span class="ph uicontrol">API Reference</span> of the respective control.</p>
