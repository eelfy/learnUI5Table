		also made sure that a Not Found page is displayed in case the app was
		called with an invalid hash. Now, we proceed further and track invalid hashes to be able to
		detect and correct any invalid links or add new URL patterns that are often requested but
		not found. Therefore, we simply listen to the bypassed events</div><section>

			<p>All we need to do is listen to the bypassed event on the router. If the bypassed event is triggered, we simply get the current hash and log a message. In
				an actual app this is probably the right place to add some application analysis features, i.e. sending analytical logs to the back end for later
				evaluation and processing. This could be used to improve the app, for example, to find out why the user called the app with an invalid hash.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

					</p><p>We have chosen to place this piece of code into the <code>App</code> controller because this is a global feature of the app. However,
						you could also place it anywhere else, for example in the <code>NotFound</code> controller file or in a helper module related to
						analysis.</p>
				<p></p></div></div>Now try to access <code>webapp/index.html#/thisIsInvalid</code> while you have your browser console open. As you can see, there is a
				message that issues a faulty hash. Furthermore, our <code>NotFound</code> page is displayed.<p></p>
