			<h2 class="title ">Overview</h2>
			<p>Aggregration forwarding is used when application developers
				want
				to add child controls
				to
				an aggregation of a composite control, but the composite control does not keep these
				controls as direct children. Instead, it moves or forwards them to an aggregation of
				one of its internal controls. </p>
			<p>This technique is often used when a control with an aggregation is wrapped by a composite
				control to add functionality, but the application
				still
				has control over the content of the
				wrapped
				control.
				In
				other cases, the composite control uses layout controls
				internally
				to define the placement of aggregated children.</p>

				</p><p>While aggregation forwarding as described here is mainly aimed at composite
					controls, it has also been implemented for the <code>ManagedObject</code>
					base class. The forwarding can also be used for other entities which are not
					controls, but inherit directly from <code>ManagedObject</code> or one of its
					subclasses.</p>For more
						information about this class, see the <a href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" title="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend">API Reference:

			<h2 class="title ">Configuration</h2>
			<p>Aggregation forwarding requires a simple additional setting in the definition of a
				control aggregation. SAPUI5 needs to know to
				which internal control all aggregated children need to be forwarded and to which
				aggregation of this internal control.</p>
			<p>Aggregation forwarding is defined in the aggregation definition inside the control
				metadata.</p>
			<p>The <code>forwarding</code> property can be set as an object defining the following:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><code>getter</code> or <code>idSuffix</code>: A way how SAPUI5
						determines the internal control instance to which the aggregation is
						forwarded at runtime, which is what you could call the target control. This
						can either be done by specifying the <code>getter</code>, the name of a
						function of the composite control which always returns the target control
						instance, or the <code>idSuffix</code>, a string which is appended to
						the ID of the composite control to construct the ID of the target
						control.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><code>aggregation</code>: The name of the aggregation of the target
						control to which this aggregation is forwarded</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><code>forwardBinding</code>
						(optional): Determines whether any binding is done
						at
						the target control or only at the outer composite
						control.
						This can be crucial if the forwarding target control has functionality that
						requires the aggregation to be bound. </p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When such a forwarding definition is done, SAPUI5 moves all
				aggregated child controls to the target control. All calls to
					<code>addAggregation</code>, <code>removeAggregation</code>,
					<code>indexOfAggregation</code> and so on are forwarded. When asked for the
				forwarded child control, both the composite control and the forwarding target act
				like the child control belongs to their aggregation. However, the inner forwarding
				target control is the actual parent of all forwarded children.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Examples</h2>
			<p>Here is an example that demonstrates aggregation forwarding: The new
					<code>FilterableList</code> control is supposed to display a list of items
				with an input field above the list. The list items are filtered while the
				user
				is entering the input. This <code>FilterableList</code>
				control can be implemented as a composite control, using the
					<code>sap.m.List</code> and <code>sap.m.Input</code> controls as inner
				controls to take advantage of their existing implementation, design, and set of
				features. Application developers using <code>FilterableList</code>
				cannot
				change all
				attributesof
				the inner <code>List</code> control. However, they should be able to provide the
				actual list items. Hence, the new <code>FilterableList</code> composite control
				has an <code>items</code> aggregation and forwards all items to the inner
					<code>sap.m.List</code> control, so, for example, the layouting, events, and
				selection can be handled
				there.</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">aggregations: {
	 // The items forwarded from the FilterableList to the internal sap.m.List
	 items : {type: "sap.m.ListItemBase", multiple: true, forwarding: {
		   idSuffix: "-myInternalList",
		   aggregation: "items"
	 }},
</pre></div></section>
			<p>Another example would be a new <code>ButtonList</code> control that is supposed
				to contain and display an arbitrary number of <code>sap.m.Button</code> controls
				in a grid. Hence it has a <code>buttons</code> aggregation. For this control,
				control-specific HTML could be written that provides screen-size-dependent CSS for a
				proper grid layout of the buttons. However, this effort can be avoided, and a
					<code>sap.ui.layout.Grid</code> control used internally instead to do the
				layouting. The buttons given to the <code>ButtonList</code> control then need to
				be forwarded to the <code>content</code> aggregation of the
					<code>Grid</code> control.</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">aggregations: {
	 // The items forwarded from the ButtonList to the internal sap.ui.layout.Grid
	 buttons: {type: "sap.m.Button", multiple: true, forwarding: {
		   getter: "_getInternalGrid",
		   aggregation: "content"
	 }},</pre></div></section>

			<h2 class="title ">Aggregation Forwarding in XML Composite Controls</h2>
			<p>If you use aggregation forwarding with <code>idSuffix</code> for an XML composite
				control, you define this as follows:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.ui.define([
    "sap/ui/core/XMLComposite"], 
    function( XMLComposite ) {
    "use strict";
    var TextList = XMLComposite.extend("fragments.TextList", {
        metadata: {
            aggregations: {
                texts: { 
                    type: "sap.ui.core.Item",
                    multiple: true, forwarding: {
                           idSuffix: "<span class="emphasis">--</span>myInternalVBox",
                           aggregation: "items"
                     }
                }
            }
        }
    })
    return TextList;
}, /* bExport= */true);</pre></div></section>
			<p>In this case, the fragment definition XML file looks like this:</p>
			<section class="lang-xml"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core"&gt;
    &lt;m:VBox id="myInternalVBox"/&gt;
&lt;/core:FragmentDefinition&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p><code>myInternalVBox</code> is prefixed with <code>--</code>. Other than
				that, the coding looks exactly the same as the one for aggregation forwarding for
				standard composite controls.</p></div></div>
		</section><section id="section_b14_ym5_scb">
			<h2 class="title ">Dos and Don'ts</h2>
			<p>If you use aggregation forwarding, you have to keep the following in mind:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>Do not call any methods (such as <code>add</code>,
							<code>insert</code>, <code>remove</code> , or
							<code>destroy</code>) that modify the aggregation in the forwarding
						target, but call them in the control that defines the forwarding. </p>
					<p>For example, if you create something like a <code>CustomList</code>
						control that uses forwarding for its <code>items</code> aggregation to
						an internal <code>List</code> control, do not call
							<code>this._internalList.destroyItems()</code>, but call
							<code>this.destroyItems()</code>.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Aggregations can only be forwarded to non-hidden aggregations of the same or a greater
						multiplicity (single-to-single, single-to-multi, multi-to-multi).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The target aggregation and the source aggregation have to be compatible: Any child elements
						given
						to the source aggregation must be valid in the target
						aggregation as well (otherwise the target element will throw a validation
						error).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The aggregation target control for a particular instance of a composite control must stay
						the same across the entire
						lifecycle
						of the composite control.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>If the content in the target aggregation is modified by other
						entities
						or actions, such as the target control itself or another
						forwarding from a different source aggregation, this
						will
						lead to an unexpected behavior of the aggregation forwarding. Hence, these
						modifications are not allowed.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Forwarded child controls always have the same models that were also available at their
						original location <span class="emphasis">before</span> the forwarding. They will not
						use any
						models
						that are only set for the inner control to which they are forwarded. This
						way, models set by an application will not be overridden.</p>
					<p>Also, this is in accordance with what application developers would expect
						regarding the models set for the child control: Any bindings they define
						should work regardless of how aggregation forwarding is used within the
						controls.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Never clone children in public aggregations even if the aggregation is
						forwarded to an inner control. They are cloned automatically by the
						framework.</p>
					<p>Also, do not clone inner controls created by your composite control, for
						example, inside the <code>init()</code> method: If your control is
						cloned, the <code>init()</code> method of the clone is called, and the
						inner control is created
						as
						well.</p>
				</li>
