		saved as an active version. Drafts are saved automatically in the background whenever users
		add or change information within a business entity while it's in edit mode (auto-save). SAP
		Fiori elements support the creation of apps using draft handling.</div><p>Drafts are used as follows:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>To keep unsaved changes when an editing activity is interrupted. This lets users resume editing later.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>To prevent data loss if an app terminates unexpectedly</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>As a locking mechanism to prevent multiple users from editing the same object at the same time, and to inform users about unsaved
					changes by another user.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>When a user starts creating a new business entity or edits an existing one, a draft is created in the background. This enables field
			validation and dynamic field control (showing additional fields based on user interaction) and provides default values for fields based on
			recent data entry. A draft can be validated for consistency and completeness at any time. This returns a list of messages.</p><p>While the user is modifying a business entity, an indicator shows when a draft is saved implicitly. The user still needs to choose
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span> to incorporate the changes into an active business document.</p><section id="section_mvv_ts2_pmb">
			<h2 class="title ">Using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span> Button</h2>
			<p>The footer bar of a subobject page contains an <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span> button in create mode and edit mode. When users choose this
				button they can conclude their current create or edit activity, apply the changes or entries to the draft, and navigate one step up in
				the object hierarchy.</p>
			<p>When a user edits an object, the system behavior of the <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span> button is as follows: <img src="loio36204dc3fff942668f0c38c93d6684d6_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></p>
			<ol>
				<li class="li">
					<p>On an object page, the user chooses <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit</span>. </p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The system creates a draft version of the object.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The user makes changes to the draft version of the object and navigates to a detail page. When <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span> is
						chosen, the changes are applied to the draft.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>When the user chooses <span class="ph uicontrol">Save</span>, the changes are saved to the active version of the object.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If the <code>DiscardAction</code> has been defined in the <code>DraftRoot</code> annotation, the
						<code>DiscardAction</code> is called if the user chooses to delete the draft. If the <code>DiscardAction</code> has
					not been defined, the <code>Delete</code> call is triggered instead.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
		</section><section id="section_qvv_ts2_pmb">
			<h2 class="title ">Handling Inconsistent Input</h2>
			<p>Users might enter data that is so inconsistent that the system cannot store it in the draft. For example, characters are entered in a
				number field, or more characters than the field length allows are entered. If this is the case, the contents of the UI differ from the
				contents of the draft. Before the draft can be saved by the user, the system displays a message prompting the users to solve these
				errors. After all errors have been solved, the draft can be saved.</p>
			<p>This system behavior is also valid when using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span> button. When choosing <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span>, the
				system has to make sure that the contents on the UI and the stored contents of the draft are identical. If the errors described above
				occur, the system displays the same message prompting the user to solve them.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>This message lists only errors related to technical inconsistencies, not to logical inconsistencies. For example, if a user enters
					a business partner that does not exist, this error is not displayed. These types of errors are displayed in a state message when
					saving the object.</p>
