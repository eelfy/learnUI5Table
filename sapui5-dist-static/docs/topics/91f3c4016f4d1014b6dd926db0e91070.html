		<h2 class="title ">Input Validation</h2> 
		<p>From the application point of view, the validation of user input must be done on the server
				and, optionally, on the client. This can be achieved by using two-way data binding
				and model types.</p> 
		<p>From the control point of view, the input of control properties must be validated, so that
				integer properties only accept integers and enumeration properties only accept an
				existing enumeration value. While this sounds obvious, in JavaScript it is not. The
				type system of JavaScript does not do type validation on assignment.</p>

		<h2 class="title ">Output Encoding</h2> 
		<p>All data sent from the server must be properly
		  output encoded according to the context they are contained in. For more
		  information, see <a href="#/topic/91f0bd316f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a widely known vulnerability most web sites have. This page does not provide general information about cross-site scripting but focuses on what you as an application developer using SAPUI5 can do to avoid these security issues." class="sap-doc">Cross-Site Scripting</a>. 
		</p> 
		<p>Content, which is created on the client side either for display within the browser or for data
				transport, needs to be properly output encoded with the encoding methods provided by
					SAPUI5. There are
				methods for encoding HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and URI components. </p> 
	 	<p>All controls in SAPUI5 libraries properly encode their data, except for HTML-control and
				XMLView. The latter two are explicitly built to display arbitrary HTML content. If
				applications use these two controls and provide unsecure HTML content, they have to
				check/validate the content on their own. </p> 
		<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>Using an XMLView with application controlled
			secure HTML content together with standard SAPUI5 controls (other than HTML and
		  XMLView) containing potentially unsecure data is also safe. Only untrusted HTML
		  content is critical.

		<h2 class="title ">URL Validation</h2> 
		<p>URL validation should take place on the server-side when possible. In case URLs are entered on the client-side or are loaded from an external
				service, SAPUI5 offers a URL validator, which can be used to validate
				whether a URL is well formed and properly encoded. It also contains a configurable allowlist to restrict URLs to certain protocols or
				certain hosts. Initially, the allowlist only checks for the <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, and <code>ftp</code>
				protocols, but nothing else. Applications should define their own allowlist. </p>

		<h2 class="title ">Cache Settings</h2> 
		<p>The application has to take care that caching of
		  data is disabled by setting appropriate HTTP headers on the server-side. 
		</p> 
	 	<p>Static resources from SAPUI5 or from the
		  application are not security relevant and are excluded from this rule, so they
		  can safely be cached on the client. 
		</p> 
	 </section><section id="section_A2E00DC0967241E89AF9B3E54CF7FDF3"> 
		<h2 class="title ">User Management / Authentication</h2> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 does not provide any
				authorization or user management. An application, which implements such facilities
				based on SAPUI5 has to
				make sure that SSL/TLS is enabled to prevent cleartext passwords sent over the wire.
				Applications must not store any logon information on the client. </p> 
	 </section><section id="section_6ABD0CE1F88C4767A82E92D7295274C3"> 
		<h2 class="title ">Local Storage</h2> 
		<p>The local storage of browsers is not a secure
		  storage, so while it can be used for static data, like enumerations,
		  applications must not store any user or application data within the local
		  storage.
