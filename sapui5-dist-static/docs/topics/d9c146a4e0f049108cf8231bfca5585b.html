            cannot produce the required behavior by other means, such as manifest settings or
            annotations. To correctly integrate your app extension coding with SAP Fiori elements,
            use only the extensionAPI of SAP Fiori elements. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/bd2994b69ef542998becbc69ab093f7e.html" title="The extensionAPI consists of several elements that are described below. It can be used for the list report and object page." class="sap-doc">Using the extensionAPI</a>. </p><p>After you've created an app

                example, model and binding usage, busy handling) of the app extension lies within
                the application's responsibility. SAP Fiori elements provides support only for the
                official extensionAPI functions. Don't access or manipulate SAP Fiori elements'

			<p>In extension coding, you can use the standard SAPUI5 programming API.
				However, you should do so with care.</p>
			<p>After you have defined a view extension, you can access and modify the properties of all UI elements defined within these extensions
				(such as changing the visibility). You can access the elements you have created by their ID. However, you must not access any UI
				elements that are not defined within your view extensions.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you do not adhere to this guideline, your app may

					exchange controls for new ones that have a different API.</p></div></div><p></p>

			<h2 class="title ">Notes on Models</h2>
			<p>Several models (instances of <code>sap.ui.model.Model</code>) are attached to the list report and object page, and analytical list
				page template artifacts.</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">OData Model</span>
					<p>The most prominent is the default model. This is the OData model specified in the <code>manifest.json</code> file. You can
						use this model for data-binding in your own view extensions.</p><p>Access the model (through the standard SAPUI5 API methods) with care, since side effects may interfere with
						the template coding that also uses this model.</p></li>
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">UI Model</span>
					<p>Each view has its own model attached that has the name <code>ui</code>. This model can be used in view and controller
						extensions for read purposes.</p><p>Note that it is also possible to register changes to these properties. However, the logic
						that determines at which point in time these properties are set and reset can still be changed.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

						strictly forbidden to perform any change operations on the properties of the UI model.</p></div></div></li>

					<span class="emphasis">SAP Fiori Elements Private Model</span>
					<p>Additional model that is attached to each view that contains properties used for internal purposes within the
						templates.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p> It is strictly forbidden to access this model in any way. Do not access any model other

						yourself.</p></div></div></li>
				<li class="li">
					<span class="emphasis">Application-Specific Models</span>
					<p>You may want to define your own JSON model and attach it to UI elements. You can do this easily if the model is attached to a
						UI element that exists only within the scope of an extension. However, use models that are attached to a higher level (for
						example, to the whole view) only if absolutely necessary. In this case, you should use a name containing your own namespace to
						clearly separate this model from models defined by other parts of the framework.</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p>For the extension of any system logic or functions that are related to existing controls or components provided by SAP Fiori
						elements, always use the extensionAPI. It is the official interface between the actual extension and the functions provided by
						SAP Fiori elements. SAP guarantees implemented system behavior, functions, and compatibility only if the official interface is
						used correctly. This is the prerequisite for receiving the necessary support and quality assurance.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>If you interact only with controls that were generated within your extension, you don't need the ExtensionAPI.</p>
				</li>
			</ul><p>Make sure you do not use the following:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Services provided by the namespace <code>sap.ui.generic.app</code>, since these services are intended for use only by
					freestyle-apps or within the generic list report and object page and analytical list page template implementation. </li>
				<li class="li">Services provided directly by the namespace <code>sap.ui.generic.template</code>. Unwanted side effects may occur if two
					layers (template coding and extension coding) access these services at the same time. </li>

				<h3 class="title ">Notes on Models</h3>
				<p>Access the model (through the standard SAPUI5 API methods) with care,
