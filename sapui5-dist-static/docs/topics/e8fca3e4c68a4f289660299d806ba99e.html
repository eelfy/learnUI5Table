			<h2 class="title ">Keep Your Library Dependencies Up To Date</h2>
			<p>Always define the libraries you use in the manifest and remove all libraries that you do not intend to use in your code. If you have no
				manifest, you have to specify the used libraries in the SAPUI5 bootstrap.
				If you specify the used libraries in either place, they are loaded optimized. This means that all used controls, styles, etc. are not
				requested separately. For every mentioned library, the library preload file, the library styles, and the text translations are loaded
				once during the application startup. No further requests are necessary while using the application, because all needed artefacts are
				already included in the respective library preload file.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Declare Local Dependencies</h2>
			<p>In the JavaScript files of your app, define all dependencies to SAPUI5
				framework classes and app resources via <code>sap.ui.define</code>. If you have unused dependencies, you should remove them right
				away.</p>
			<p>The UI5 Tooling can then create a "cleaned-up" version of your app that only contains the resources you really need. The so-called application
				preload will greatly speed up the initial load time of your app.</p>
