			<h2 class="title ">The 3 Main Folders</h2>
			<p>The 3 main folders in an application are the <code>root</code> folder, the <code>webapp</code> folder and the
					<code>test</code> folder. Regarding their structure, the <code>webapp</code> folder should be inside the
					<code>root</code> folder, and the <code>test</code> folder should be located inside the
					<code>webapp</code> folder, as shown below:</p>

					example. This applies to all images contained within this topic.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p><span class="emphasis">The <code>root</code> Folder</span></p>
			<p>The root folder should contain files that are not part of your application coding.
				Examples are build configuration files, such as a <code>pom.xml</code> for
				maven or a <code>Gruntfile.js</code> for node/grunt, and documentation files
				like <code>readme.md</code> or <code>txt</code>. These files may
				also be grouped in folders if needed. For example, you could group all documentation
				files into a <code>doc</code> folder.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">The <code>webapp</code> Folder</span></p>
			<p>The <code>webapp</code> folder contains all the code that is related to the
				application. This means running and extending the application using the
					<span class="emphasis">extensibility</span> mechanism offered by SAPUI5. This includes
				the JavaScript files for the logic, view files written in xml, html, json or js
				format, and also files for <span class="emphasis">localization</span>, such as
					<code>i18n.properties</code> files. Any files that are only relevant for
				testing should be put inside the <code>test</code> folder. For more details
				about the <code>webapp</code> folder, see the section below. For more
				information about extensibility and localization, see <a href="#/topic/a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html" title="You can adapt an SAPUI5 app to your specific requirements. For example, you can adapt or replace views, extend or replace controllers, or change language-specific texts." class="sap-doc">Extending Apps</a> and <a href="#/topic/91f217c46f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The framework concepts for text localization in SAPUI5 are aligned with the general concepts of the Java platform." class="sap-doc">Localization</a> respectively.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">The <code>test</code> Folder</span></p>
			<p>The <code>test</code> folder contains all of the files needed for running automated
				tests for your application, as well as for launching your application in a sandbox
				mode so that you can do manual testing. For more details about the
					<code>test</code> folder, see the section below.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Why Use 3 Separate Folders?</span></p>
			<p>To achieve sound performance when loading your application, the code you deploy to your
				production servers should only contain a <code>component-preload.js</code>
				and a <code>manifest.json</code> file. This means that when you create a
				package with a build, it is easier if all the files you really want to deploy are
				inside <span class="emphasis">one</span> folder. This is true no matter which build framework
				you use. We recommend using the <code>webapp</code> folder for this. Nothing
				inside the <code>root</code> folder is needed for running the app, so it's
				not included on a production server serving your application. The content of the
					<code>test</code> folder has to be executed in design time and during
				the automated test execution on a central server. We choose to include it inside the
					<code>webapp</code> folder, to be able to reference resources of the
					<code>webapp</code> folder relatively to the <code>test</code>
				folder. This folder has to be excluded when you are building a
					<code>component-preload.js</code>. You should never reference resources
				of the <code>test</code> folder from your application, because when you
				deploy to a productive environment, the resource cannot be loaded. For more
				information about the <code>manifest.json</code> file, see <a href="#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries (in short: app descriptor) is inspired by the WebApplication Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable, and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library." class="sap-doc">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>
		</section><section><h2 class="title ">The <code>webapp</code> Folder in Detail</h2><p>Aside from the <code>test</code> folder, the <code>webapp</code> folder contains
				3 folders related to the MVC (model, view, controller) pattern used in SAPUI5, as well as a
				localization folder and a local-services folder used for emulating OData services.
				Each of these folders is outlined below.</p>
			<p>For standalone app, this folder also contains an <code>index.html</code> file that is used to start the app and to instantiate the
				component. If your apps is built for the SAP Fiori launchpad no <code>index.html</code> file is created but only files for
				testing the app in the FLP sandbox.</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loio5d11418f5cdf4eac85c9dc7784a97df1_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p><span class="emphasis">The <code>view</code> Folder</span></p><p>In the <code>view</code> folder, you should put all SAPUI5
				<span class="emphasis">views</span> and <span class="emphasis">fragments</span>. This folder should
				not contain any application logic, so no JavaScript files unless you are using
				JavaScript views. JavaScript views are not recommended because it is easier to mix
				controller logic when building up a view. In declarative views this is not possible.
				In the example shown below, the <code>view</code> folder contains a mixture
				of views and fragments. If this folder gets too big, you might consider adding
				subfolders to group views by their semantics. In this example for instance, you
				could add a <code>detail</code> folder and move all views that are related
				to the detail area of your application to this subfolder.</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loiod5340cbbd7ae423db38ed4b8b236daf2_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>For more information about views and fragments, see <a href="#/topic/91f27e3e6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The view in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept is responsible for defining and rendering the UI. SAPUI5 supports predefined view types." class="sap-doc">Views</a> and <a href="#/topic/36a5b130076e4b4aac2c27eebf324909.html" title="Fragments are light-weight UI parts (UI sub-trees) which can be reused, defined similar to views, but do not have any controller or other behavior code involved." class="sap-doc">Reusing UI Parts: Fragments</a> respectively.</p><p><span class="emphasis">The <code>controller</code> Folder</span></p><p>The <code>controller</code> folder contains all the controllers used by your views, and
				might also contain additional logic files that are used by one or more controllers.
				The structure of the <code>controller</code> folder should mirror the
					<code>view</code> folder. If a view is in a subfolder, the controller of
				the view should also be in the corresponding subfolder.</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loio0e935c5607ed4ca3bf910ff267416245_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p><span class="emphasis">The <code>model</code>
				Folder</span></p><p>The <code>model</code> folder is where you put any files needed for creating models and
				logic relating to model data. This includes grouping, filtering and formatting
				data.</p><div><div class="fig"><img src="loiof990b6e5f10c4386835d49495dc4259c_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><p>In the above example, <code>models.js</code> is a factory for creating models that are
				used by our application.</p><p><span class="emphasis">Localization Folder -
					<code>i18n</code></span></p><p>We also have one dedicated folder for <span class="emphasis">localization</span> files. An SAPUI5 app will
				potentially be translated into many languages. Each of those languages has its own
					<code>.properties</code> file. Note that although the
					<span class="keynote apiname">ResourceModel</span> is an SAPUI5 model from a
				technical point of view, the localization folder is <span class="emphasis">not</span> part of
				the <code>model</code> folder. This is because the
					<code>.properties</code> files have a different semantic since they are
				used for translation. The code needed to instantiate the
					<span class="keynote apiname">ResourceModel</span> is located in the <code>model</code>
				folder. For more information about localization, see <a href="#/topic/91f217c46f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The framework concepts for text localization in SAPUI5 are aligned with the general concepts of the Java platform." class="sap-doc">Localization</a>. For more

					</p><p>The path to the <code>i18n</code> file must not exceed 100
						characters.</p>
				<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">The <code>localService</code> Folder</span></p><p>The <code>localService</code> folder is used to emulate OData services for tests or as a
				preview mode for your application. It is also intended for design-time tools since
				it contains the <code>metadata.xml</code> file, which describes the backend
				connection of your application. You need to have one
					<code>metadata.xml</code> file per OData service, which exactly matches
				the remote service’s metadata. The location of this file also needs to be maintained
				in the data sources section of the <code>manifest.json</code> file. For more
				information, see <a href="#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries (in short: app descriptor) is inspired by the WebApplication Manifest concept introduced by the W3C.

A second use case for this is for running an
				application in a <span class="emphasis">preview</span> mode so that it serves data locally instead of connecting to a back end. This is why
				this folder also contains files necessary for starting up the OData V2 mock server. The data served by the mock server is put inside
				the <code>mockdata</code> folder. If you need to, you can also include multiple sets of mock data here, by giving each set its
				own folder. For more information about the OData V2 mock server, see the <a href="#/api/sap.ui.core.util.MockServer" title="#/api/sap.ui.core.util.MockServer" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.core.util.MockServer">API

			<p>The <code>test</code> folder contains three sets of files: files related to unit tests, files related to integration tests, and html
				files for either launching the tests or for testing the application manually. Inside the <code>unit</code> folder, the
				structure of the <code>webapp</code> folder is replicated for the files that are being tested.</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio7958ae4e55c6419b90320a45cbcc72ae_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>In this example shown above, the files being tested are
					<code>webapp/model/formatter.js</code> and
					<code>webapp/model/models.js</code>. You may be using JavaScript files
				or html files to run your tests, depending on the runners you are executing your
				tests with. We recommend using <code>.js</code> files for writing your
				tests, so that you can run them with tools such as karma for instance.</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio05316ff7b0c94c00afc68f25a67ee4cf_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>The <code>integration</code> folder contains the OPA tests of your application. We
				decided to separate our unit and integration tests, since the execution time of the
				integration tests is much longer. While the unit tests run in less than 10 seconds,
				the integration tests run for over 2 minutes. These times will vary a lot depending
				on the size of your project. If the project grows and grows, the difference in the
				execution time will also grow. For this reason, we recommend making both kind of
				tests separately executable so that developers can choose which sets of tests they
				want to run during design time.</p>
