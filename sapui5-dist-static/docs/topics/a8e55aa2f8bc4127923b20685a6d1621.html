							<p>Flexibility is key! Enterprise software must adapt to rapidly changing environments. For example, customers need their apps to fit their
								processes without long IT projects to adapt them, and cloud providers want to run the same software for everyone to
								reduce TCO. You think adapting the user interface of SAP Fiori
								apps (for example, by adding, hiding or rearranging fields) is a complex process? Think again! SAPUI5 flexibility features allow upgrade-safe and
								modification-free UI changes on different levels (for example, at customer side) that can be performed by different
								users (end users, key users, and developers).</p>

			</table></div></div><p><span class="emphasis">Here are four reasons why you want to use SAPUI5 flexibility:</span></p><p>
			</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">It allows modification-free UI changes.</span></p>
					<p>In contrast to extension points, UI changes made with SAPUI5 flexibility are
						modification-free. This means better lifecycle stability over release cycles, as the original app stays untouched and the
						changes are applied to the views only at runtime. This is achieved by storing the changes by the different users in separate
						layers. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/9e6305746b8742f69faa55fae27ee220.html" title="SAPUI5 flexibility uses a consistent layering concept to store the UI changes as semantic delta information. This layering concept applies consistently to all users of SAPUI5 flexibility (end users, key users, and developers)." class="sap-doc">Layering Concept</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">It saves time and money.</span></p>
					<p>In the past, changing the UI was a complex, time and money consuming process. SAPUI5
						flexibility changes all that! For example, with its <cite>key user adaptation</cite> feature, even users without technical
						knowledge can easily make UI changes themselves.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">It's easy to use.</span></p>
					<p>Using SAPUI5 flexibility makes adapting the UIs of apps simple and intuitive, with
						WYSIWYG features and tools that are available right in the context the user is working in: end users personalize object pages
						of their apps and key users adapt apps for their teams directly in the SAP Fiori launchpad; developers can use the SAPUI5 Visual Editor in SAP Business Application Studio or SAP Web IDE .</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">It's performant.</span></p>
					<p>Last but not least: This flexibility doesn't come at the expense of performance! By caching the UI changes, SAPUI5 flexibility guarantees smooth working with your adapted
						apps.</p>

					<h3 class="title visibility-trigger">Key users can adapt apps, which can then be used by all users, directly in the SAP Fiori launchpad</h3>
					<p>Here's a typical scenario: A team lead who has business knowledge, but probably no technical or development skills, wants to adapt an app for
						all users of the app. In the context of SAPUI5 flexibility, we call
						this team lead a <cite>key user</cite>. Let's assume, the users would need to see the supplier number in addition. Using the
							<cite>key user adaptation</cite> feature of SAPUI5 flexibility,
						the key user just starts the adaptation mode and changes the user interface using intuitive WYSIWYG functions. So, for
						example, it's very easy to rearrange UI elements using drag and drop or to add fields to the user interface. The supplier
						number would be added in no time. After releasing the adapted version of the app, it's available for all users working with
						the app. Depending on your platform, you can even save the adapted app as a separate app variant.</p>

					<h3 class="title visibility-trigger">Developers can adapt the UIs of existing SAPUI5 apps and enable their
						own apps for key user adaptation</h3>
					<p>If you want to change the UI of an app that you haven't developed yourself, SAPUI5
						flexibility helps you with this. You don’t need to change the source code of the original app. Instead, you use SAP’s
						development environment SAP Business Application Studio to create an adaptation
						project for the app that you want to change. This adaptation project is the basis for your UI changes. The UI changes
						themselves are made graphically in the SAPUI5 Visual Editor, which is also part of SAP Business Application Studio. As soon as you are ready with your changes, you deploy
						a “variant” of your app to the same ABAP repository that the original app belongs to. This app variant has its own app ID, but
						still references the original app – which remains untouched. If the original app is updated, this is also reflected in your
						app variant.
