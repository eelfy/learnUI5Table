At different steps of this tutorial you will write tests using QUnit,
		OPA5, and the OData V2 mock server. Additionally, you will learn about testing strategies, Test Driven Development (TDD), and much more. </div><p>For the application features that we add, we focus on writing clean and testable code
			with the goal of having good test coverage and a high quality app. We will create a
			simple full screen app that we will extend with more tests and features throughout the
			tutorial.</p><p>Imagine the following situation: You and your development team take over a bulletin board
			prototype that will be shipped as a product soon. A bulletin board typically consists of
			functionality to browse posts and add own offers to the board. However, the prototype
			only covers a minimum set of features and tests so far.</p><p>With this very minimalistic app as a starting point, we have a good foundation and we can
			inspect the most important testing functionality. Furthermore, we want to implement new
			features for the app that were requested by the product team using Test Driven
			Development and best practices for writing testable code and testing SAPUI5 apps.</p><p>So why do we do all this? Obviously, writing tests and testable code does not come
			without effort. Well, we want to ensure the implementation of a high quality app by
			having decent test coverage of our application logic. And we check that our code does
			not break by running the automated tests whenever we change something or when we upgrade
			to a newer version of the SAPUI5 framework or other
			external libraries. Additionally, we can find bugs proactively and do not need excessive
			manual testing anymore so the efforts definitely pay off. Also, when we decide to
			refactor something in the future, we can easily verify that the features of the app are
			still working as expected.</p><p>There are a lot more reasons and many small details that we will address throughout this
			tutorial. You can work yourself through the steps by applying the code deltas
			individually or by downloading the samples for each step and playing around with it. </p><section>

			<h2 class="title ">Prerequisites</h2>
			<p>In addition to the prerequisites that are presupposed for all our tutorials (see <a href="#/topic/8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218.html#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218/tutorials_prerequisites" title="8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218.xml#loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218/tutorials_prerequisites" class="sap-doc">Prerequisites</a>), you should also be familiar with the basics of
				JavaScript unit testing with QUnit. Have a look at the official QUnit documentation
				to make yourself familiar with basic testing knowledge. Steps 27 to 29 of the
				Walkthrough tutorial also cover the test setup in an app that is used throughout
				this tutorial.</p>
			<p>If you want to automate the test execution using a test runner, you can set this up as
				described under <a href="#/topic/ae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0.html#loioae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0" title="To make sure that the code is always tested thoroughly before it is included in a productive app, you should use a test runner that automates tests. The test runner can be included in your project setup so that it is called whenever code changes are submitted." class="sap-doc">Test Automation</a>.</p>

				</p><p>You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly
					to any step you want. Just download the code from the previous step, and start
					there.</p>
				<p>You can view and download the files for all steps in the Demo Kit at <a href="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.testing" title="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.testing" class="sap-doc" alt="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.testing">Testing Apps</a>. Copy the code to your workspace and make sure
					that the application runs by calling the <code>webapp/test/test.html</code>
					file. Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust
					resource paths and configuration entries.</p>
