        the view/elements structure and control properties to the dynamic, data and event-driven
        interactions. You can traverse the DOM tree, look at error logs during startup or check the
        CSS.</div><section>

                Tree</h2>
            <p>With these rules you can check how your application is rendered and how properties of
                the controls affect the rendering. Here is an example:
                </p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">var mElements = oScope.getElements();
for (var n in mElements) {
  ...

            <h2 class="title ">Rules for the Console Traces and Logging</h2>
            <p>Rules that analyze the console trace allow you to react to dynamic events while the
                application is loading. They can help you catch common errors in the binding and
                bootstrapping of the application. One such rule (<span class="ph uicontrol">Error Logs</span>)
                is already created and catches all the errors from the console. </p>
            <p>With version 1.46, the logging API has been enhanced to allow additional objects to
                be added to logs produced by any module. An additional callback function in a log
                statement can provide such additional objects, which can be stored with the log
                entry.</p>

                    information, see the <a href="#/api/module%3Asap%2Fbase%2FLog" title="#/api/module%3Asap%2Fbase%2FLog" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/module%3Asap%2Fbase%2FLog">API Reference:

            <p>Here is an example of how to log a warning with additional support
                information:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// "Log" required from module "sap/base/Log"
//enable to log additional support information, this is automatically turned on if the url parameter: sap-ui-support is set to true
Log.logSupportInfo(true)

Log.warning("Log this text", function() {
  //return additional object for further processing in support tooling
  return {
    type: "sap.mylib.supportType", //type can be used to filter the logs in support tooling
    elementId: "sap.mylib.Class or ID" //can be given to narrow the scope of support tooling to a certain element ID, normally used as control ID.
    mylogobject: {
      context: "Identify Context"
    }
  }
});</pre></div></section>

                set custom design preferences, you need to overwrite or manipulate the CSS styling
                rules. However, this bears a risk because inappropriate changes in the standard
                styles might provoke rendering or representation issues.</p><p>Below, you can find
                examples of specific Support Assistant rules to check in such situations.</p><section>
                <h3 class="title ">Getting all loaded style sheets</h3>
            </section><p>To get all loaded style sheets, you simply need to call the
                    <code>document.styleSheets</code> method. This method returns a list of all
                inline and external CSS rules. You can further filter or search for a specific style
                depending on your needs.</p><section>
                <h3 class="title ">Getting a list of all custom CSS file paths</h3>
            </section><p>By custom CSS files we mean all files and styles that are not included
                within a standard <code>library.css</code> file. Here is an example function
                that filters all loaded styles and returns only those specific file paths. Once you
                have a list of all custom CSS files, you can do your further analysis.</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">getExternalStyleSheets: function() {
  return Array.from(document.styleSheets).filter(function(styleSheet) {
    var themeName = sap.ui.getCore().getConfiguration().getTheme(),
      styleSheetEnding = "/themes/" + themeName + "/library.css",
      hasHref = !styleSheet.href || !styleSheet.href.endsWith(styleSheetEnding),
      hasRules = !!styleSheet.rules;

    return hasHref && hasRules;
  });

                        <code>inline</code> or <code>external</code> file</h3>
                <p>If you iterate over <code>document.styleSheets</code> elements, you will see
                    that each element has a property <code>href</code> containing the full path
                    to the style sheet. If it's empty, it means that the style is
                        <code>inline</code>. Here is an example function that returns the full
                    path to a specific style sheet when loaded externally and
                        <code>inline</code> if the applied style is added by a
                        <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag:</p>

                <h3 class="title ">Determining if a specific CSS rule is applied on a
                    node</h3>
            </section><p>Each style sheet object contains a property called
                    <code>rules</code>. This property is a <code>CSSRuleList</code> of all
                    <code>CSSStyleRules</code> that are inside this style sheet. Each rule has
                its own property <code>selectorText</code> that contains a selector of a rule.
                To get all nodes that contain that selector, we can use
                    <code>document.querySelectorAll(rule.selectorText)</code>. Here is a simple
                example where we get all rules and find all nodes that contain each rule
                selector:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">Array.from(styleSheet.rules).forEach(function(rule) {
