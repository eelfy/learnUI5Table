		mechanisms for observing the moving focus in an application page for controls. This
		information is then preserved for refocusing elements after rerendering. The focus triggers
		event firing. However, due to the high degree of flexibility in control rendering, a
		functionality tailored to the respective controls is required. For this, the framework
		provides helper functions for the implementation of focus handling.</div><p>Each control provided by the SAPUI5 framework has its
			own behavior for focus handling, depending on the functionality that is provided by the
			control. Complex controls and their embedded content constitute the highest level of
			complexity.</p><p>The base class for elements (<code>Element.js</code>) provides the following four
			methods to support the implementation of focus handling: </p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>
					<code>Element.getFocusDomRef()</code>
				</p>
				<p>Once a visible element is rendered, it has a Document Object Model (DOM)
					representation. The root DOM node can be accessed by using the method
						<code>getDomRef()</code> on the element. The root DOM node is the
					default focused DOM node. After rendering, when a control is supposed to be
					focused, the framework asks the control for its focus DOM node by using the
						<code>getFocusDomRef()</code> method. If the root DOM node does
						<span class="emphasis">not</span> represent the element that should have the focus,
					you have to return another DOM node by overriding the
						<code>getFocusDomRef()</code> method. </p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>
					<code>Element.focus()</code>
				</p>
				<p>The <code>focus()</code> method sets the focus on the element. This is done
					using the focus DOM node. </p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>
					<code>Element.getFocusInfo()</code>
				</p>
				<p>For some controls, it is even more difficult to apply the focus once the control
					has been rerendered. List controls, for example, have their own internal focus
					handling and set the focus on the different items. A data table moves the focus
					over a matrix of cells. The requirement is that a control can apply the focus to
					its exact previous position after rerendering. In cases where the SAPUI5 rendering
					mechanism fails to find the correct element after rendering (for example,
					because it does not have an ID or the ID changed), override the
						<code>getFocusInfo()</code> method and serialize the focus state into a
					JSON object and return it. Before rendering, the render manager calls this
					method for the element instance and stores this information for future use.
					After rendering, it calls the <code>applyFocusInfo()</code> method and
					passes back the serialized object. This is not only useful for focus
					information, but also, for example, the exact cursor position of a
						<code>TextField</code> control, can be stored in such an object.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>
					<code>Element.applyFocusInfo(oFocusInfo)</code>
				</p>
				<p>The <code>applyFocusInfo()</code> method applies the focus to the element
					after rerendering. You use this method if a different behavior is expected for
					the element. The default implementation of this method sets the focus as it is
					implemented in the <code>focus()</code> method (see above). </p>
			</li>
		</ul><section id="section_52A752721BCF4CFBB9D724F17370144A">
			<h2 class="title ">Example</h2>
			<p>In the following example, the control would usually set the focus on the second child
				node of its root node. In this case, simply override the
					<code>getFocusDomRef()</code> method:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.m.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.getFocusDomRef = function() {
   return this.getDomRef().firstChild.nextSibling;
}</pre></div></section>
			<p>Another control generally sets the focus back to the element that previously had the
				focus. Therefore, it overrides the methods <code>getFocusInfo</code> and
					<code>applyFocusInfo</code>. </p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.m.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.getFocusInfo = function() {
   return {id:this.getId(),idx:this.&lt;myFocusElementIndex&gt;};
}

sap.m.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.applyFocusInfo = function(oFocusInfo) {
   var oDomRef = this.getDomRef();
   if (oDomRef) {
      this.&lt;myFocusElementIndex&gt; = oFocusInfo.idx;
      this.focus();
   }
}</pre></div></section>
