					<span class="ph sap-technical-name">draft</span>.</p><p>When a user clicks on the chevron in a list report table and navigates to an object

   &lt;/Collection&gt;
&lt;/Annotation&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p></p></div></div><p>If the application developer does not define the annotations for the semantic keys, the URL contains only the technical keys. In this case, if
				user A shares the URL via the "share" functionality with user B, user B will only be able to open the list report page if user A
				shares while being in display mode. If user A is already in edit mode when the URL is shared, then user B will not be able to open the
				link, since user B cannot access the draft of user
				A.</p><p>If, however, the application developer has defined semantic keys, the URL only
				contains semantic keys. In this case, user B will be able to open the shared URL,
				irrespective of whether user A shares the active copy (display mode) or the draft
				copy (edit mode). If user A shares the draft copy, then user B sees the
				corresponding active copy of the object.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

				</p><p>Semantic bookmarking is currently not supported in the following cases:</p>
				<ul class="ul ">

							pages</p>
					</li>
					
					<li class="li">
						<p>if not all of the semantic keys defined for the entity set are part of the available context</p>
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				<p>In these cases, changing to edit mode results in the technical keys being added to the URL. If user A now shares the URL while in
					edit mode, then user B will not be able to open the link, since user B cannot access the draft of user A for the same record.</p>
