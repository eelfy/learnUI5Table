		(mobile, desktop, tablet). </div><p>For example, the <code>sap.m.Carousel</code> control shows the left and right navigation buttons in addition to gesture only when it runs on
			desktop. The distinction between desktop and mobile behaviors should be done by checking <code>sap.ui.Device.system.desktop</code> but
			NOT <code>sap.ui.Device.support.touch</code>, because some desktop browsers can also support touch, for example on devices supporting
			both mouse and touch input.</p><p> A property <code>combi</code> is provided in <code>sap.ui.Device.support</code>, which allows you to tell whether the browser supports
			both touch and mouse interfaces.</p><p>Not all browsers on devices supporting both mouse and touch input may support touch events. Some browsers may fire mouse events when the user
			operates them by touch. Since those mouse events are not marked with <code>_sapui_delayedMouseEvents</code>, they can still be handled
			with SAPUI5 event delegation and the registered handler.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
