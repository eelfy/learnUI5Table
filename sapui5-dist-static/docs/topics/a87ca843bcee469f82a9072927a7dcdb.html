				<h3 class="title ">sap.ui.commons</h3>
				<p>The <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons</span> library is deprecated as of version 1.38.</p>
				<p><span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons</span> was available from the very beginning of SAPUI5. It contains
					a large number of basic UI controls like buttons, input fields and dropdowns.
					With version 1.16, the <span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span> library was introduced. It
					contains semantically identical controls (button, input and select) that, at
					that time, were only supported on mobile platforms. In later versions,
						<span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span> was extended to support desktop platforms as well.
					For more information about this, see <a href="#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933.html" title="Browser and platform support for the SAPUI5 libraries on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms." class="sap-doc">Browser and Platform Support</a>. The
						<span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span> controls were bigger in size to support mobile
					displays that require a larger touch area. The “Compact Content Density” feature
					explained under <a href="#/topic/e54f729da8e3405fae5e4fe8ae7784c1.html" title="The devices used to run apps that are developed with SAPUI5 run on various different operating systems and have very different screen sizes. SAPUI5 contains different content densities for certain controls that allow your app to adapt to the device in question, allowing you to display larger controls for touch-enabled devices and a smaller, more compact design for devices that are operated by mouse." class="sap-doc">Content Densities</a> was then
					added to SAPUI5,
					allowing you to display a control in a more compact screen size. Today,
					applications should be built one single time using <span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span> (and
					other libraries) and their content density switched at runtime depending on the
					environment. As such, the redundant library <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons</span>
					should no longer be used.</p>
				<p>Some of the controls in <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons.layout</span> have been replaced by the new dedicated layout library called
						<span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.layout</span>, which runs on the same platforms as <span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span>.</p>
				<p>Some of the old controls have been made available again through the non-deprecated <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.unified</span> library (e.g.
					FileUploader, Menu), which runs on the same platforms as <span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span>.</p>
				<p>Some concepts such as Accordion and Row Repeater have been abandoned completely.</p>

				<h3 class="title ">sap.ui.ux3</h3>
				<p>The <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.ux3</span> library is deprecated as of version 1.38.</p>
				<p>This library contains more complex UI controls that were based on <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons</span> along the UX3 design approach. The
						<span class="keynote apiname">sap.m</span> library - successor to <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.commons</span> - implements SAP’s new SAP Fiori design
					[http://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/], which supersedes UX3. As such, the <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ui.ux3</span> library is also deprecated. Some
					of the UX3 concepts are reflected in SAP Fiori, some are abandoned, as outlined in the following table:</p><div class="tableWrapper "><div class="fig"><tgroup>

				<h3 class="title ">sap.ca</h3>
				<p>The <span class="keynote apiname">sap.ca</span> library is deprecated as of version 1.22. </p>
