		for asynchronous loading.</div><p>Applications benefit from the configuration of the SAPUI5 module loader to
			work asynchronously. However, if an application or library is not yet fully compatible
			with asynchronous loading, you may encounter issues. To avoid running into these issues,
			the following list provides information that helps you to find out whether your
			application needs to be adapted to enable asynchronous loading. The list is not
			exhaustive, but points to additional information and should give you a good start in
			getting your applications ready for asynchronous loading.</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>For asynchronous loading, your application modules have to facilitate the concept for defining and handling of modules in SAPUI5 that is aligned with the asynchronous module definition (AMD)
					standard. For an overview, see <a href="#/topic/00737d6c1b864dc3ab72ef56611491c4.html" title="This section provides best practices for SAPUI5 module loading patterns." class="sap-doc">Best Practices for Loading Modules</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Existing applications may still use synchronous variants of factory methods. To make your
					application ready for asynchronous loading, you need to use  asynchronous
					variants of factory methods instead. For information how you can replace the
					synchronous variants with asynchronous variants, see <a href="#/topic/491bd9c70b9f4c4d913c8c7b4a970833.html" title="Overview of the replacement of global functions with the factory functions" class="sap-doc">Legacy Factories Replacement</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The global access to legacy APIs triggers a compatibility layer to load such modules
					synchronously and needs to be replaced to enable your application for
					asynchronous loading. For information how you replace the global access, see
						<a href="#/topic/a075ed88ef324261bca41813a6ac4a1c.html" title="Overview of the mapping of legacy APIs to the new APIs for the migration" class="sap-doc">Legacy jQuery.sap Replacement</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The Support Assistant also helps you to identify issues in your application, especially
					issues related to synchronous or asynchronous loading. For information about the
					Support Assistant, see <a href="#/topic/57ccd7d7103640e3a187ed55e1d2c163.html" title="The Support Assistant enables developers to check whether their apps are built according to the SAPUI5 best practices and guidelines." class="sap-doc">Support Assistant</a>.</p>

			<li class="li">
				<p>If your application relies on certain points in time, you may run into runtime issues when
					you switch from synchronous to asynchronous module loading and the points in
					time on which your application relies are different due to this change. Here are
					two examples of such issues:</p>
				<p>An event gets triggered before potential listeners had the chance to attach themselves.
					Whereas this may have worked for synchronous loading where the timing of module
					loading and initializing is different, this causes issues for asynchronous
					loading. To resolve this and to ensure that all modules are properly loaded and
					exectued, all necessary module dependencies for the module that actually
					triggers the event need to be handled by <code>sap.ui.require</code> or
						<code>sap.ui.define</code>.</p>
				<p>A controller listens on the <code>EventBus</code> for a certain event that is triggered
					by another controller. Depending on the loading time of the corresponding views,
					the <code>init</code> controller methods may be called at a different point
					in time. For information how to resolve this, see <a href="#/topic/00737d6c1b864dc3ab72ef56611491c4.html" title="This section provides best practices for SAPUI5 module loading patterns." class="sap-doc">Best Practices for Loading Modules</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Issues with asynchronous loading can also occur, if your application uses XML views that are
					configured to be loaded asynchronously via the <code>manifest</code>
					property, for example for the root view
						<code>sap.ui5/rootView/async=true</code>. To detect such issues, we
					recommend to do extensive (automatic) testing to ensure the application
					continues to work as expected.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><section id="section_jxt_wj5_zfb">
			<h2 class="title ">Known Incompatibilities</h2>
			<p>The <code>sap.viz</code> library uses another module loader in addition to the SAPUI5 module loader in
				some scenarios. In combination with the <code>async=true</code> configuration
				parameter, this currently leads to issues and may break your application.</p>
