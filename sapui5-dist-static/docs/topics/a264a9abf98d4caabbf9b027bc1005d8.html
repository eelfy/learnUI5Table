				1.56 and for freestyle applications. It is based on merge, supports only override of
				methods and requires additional component configurations. The extension information
				is stored in a specific area of the component configuration. It can be performed on
				a custom app that extends a delivered standard app. A replacement or extension of
				views and custom controllers can also be part of a custom app, but may not always be
				required. If no replacement and no custom controller exists, the custom app project
				only contains the component definition with the extension configuration. The
				standard app itself is not changed. The customized app becomes the start-up project
				and launches the standard app with the additional extension configuration. </p><p>For more

			role can also make extensive UI changes for apps without having to change the code.
