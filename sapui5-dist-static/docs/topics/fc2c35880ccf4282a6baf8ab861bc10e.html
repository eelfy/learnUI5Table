			<h2 class="title ">Setup</h2>
			<p>To set up your project for this tutorial, download the files for <span class="ph uicontrol">Step 1</span>
				from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Samples</span> in the Demo Kit at <a href="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/sample/sap.m.tutorial.worklist.01" title="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/sample/sap.m.tutorial.worklist.01" class="sap-doc" alt="#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/sample/sap.m.tutorial.worklist.01">Worklist App - Step 1</a>. The code
				contains a preconfigured application project that can be used as a starting point to
				develop the worklist app. You can deploy the downloaded application to a (local) Web
				server and call the <code>webapp/test/mockServer.html</code> file in your
				browser manually to start the app.</p>
			<p>To access the real service, you would need to set up a proxy service that connects
				your app project deployed on a Web server to the remote service. Due to the so
				called same-origin policy browsers deny AJAX requests to service endpoints in case
				the domain/subdomain, protocol, or port differ from the app’s domain/subdomain,
				protocol, or port. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) makes it possible to break
				out of these restrictions derived from the same-origin policy. With CORS the server
				and browser agree which cross-origin requests are allowed. Another way to bypass the
				same-origin policy is using a proxy on the same host of the app. To keep it simple,
				our app contains a test page to run the app with local mock data instead of
				retrieving the data from a real server hosted somewhere else. This way we won’t have
				any issues related to the same-origin policy of the browsers, as long as we run the
				app with our mock server.</p>

				</p><p>The texts in the <code>i18n.properties</code> file are automatically
					generated based on the template Customizing (OData entity set, entities,
					properties, and texts). The result can be incorrect texts like "Enter an
					&lt;Products&gt; name or a part of it." You should therefore revise the
					generated texts in the <code>i18n.properties </code> file.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Structure</h2>
			<p>With the downloaded code from the Demo Kit, you have an initial app structure with
				the following content inside the <code>webapp</code> folder:</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio7f6899e87d8240d5bd3fc8594e148714_HiRes.png" usemap="#"></div><span class="collapsible-icon sap-icon figcap title">Folder structure of the initial project</span></div>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Home Page</span>
							(<code>webapp/view/Worklist.view.xml</code> file)</p>
					<p>The home page of the app shows a table of products including the
						corresponding number of units in the stock. The title of the table shows how
						many items are available. A search field in the header toolbar of the table
						allows you to search for a product by name. Pressing a table row navigates
						the user to a new page that shows the details of the pressed product.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Data</span></p>
					<p>You can run the app with the real service or with the mock server serving
						mock data. In the <code>webapp/localService/mockserver.js</code>
						file, the mock server is configured. Using the mock server in this tutorial
						allows us to easily run the code even without network connection and without
						the need of having a remote server for our application data. To run the app
						with the mock server and its corresponding mock data the
							<code>/webapp/test/mockServer.html</code> file has to be called
						in the browser. </p>
					<p>The <code>webapp/localService/metadata.xml</code> file is used by the
						mock server to describe our OData service. In this step, the mock server
						will generate mock data based on this file. In a subsequent step the mock
						server will use our own custom mock data.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Configuration of the App</span></p>
					<p>In the <code>webapp/manifest.json</code> descriptor file, we configure our app. The
						descriptor file contains the following relevant sections: </p><ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">
								<p><code>sap.app</code></p>
								<p>In this section we reference an
										<code>i18n.properties</code> file and use a special
									syntax to bind the texts for the title and description
									properties. In the <code>dataSources</code> section, we tell
									our app where to find our <code>mainService</code> OData
									service. As you might guess, the URI correlates to the
										<code>rootUri</code> of our mock server instance, which
									can be found in
										<code>webapp/localService/mockserver.js</code>. It is
									important that these two paths match to allow our mock server to
									provide the test data we defined above.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><code>sap.ui5</code></p>
								<p>In the <code>sap.ui5</code> section, we declare with the
										<code>rootView</code> parameter that our
										<code>mycompany.myapp.MyWorklistApp.view.App</code> view
									shall be loaded and used as the <code>rootView</code> for
									our app.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, we define two models to be automatically
									instantiated and bound to the component: an
										<code>i18n</code> model and a default model
										<code>""</code>. The latter references our
										<code>mainService</code>
									<code>dataSource</code>, which is declared in our
										<code>sap.app</code> section as an OData 2.0 data
									source. The <code>i18n</code> file can be found at
										<code>webapp/i18n/i18n.properties</code>. The
										<code>mainService</code> data source will be mocked by
									our mock server.</p>
