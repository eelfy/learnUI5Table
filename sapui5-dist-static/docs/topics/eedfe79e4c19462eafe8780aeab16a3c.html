		automatically adapts to the size available on the respective device. </div><p>As tablets such as iPad or Google Nexus7 provide more space compared to smartphones,
			porting existing mobile apps to tablets leads to a lot of unused space.</p><p>A common pattern to address this is called master-detail, and is often used in native iOS and
			Android development. Good examples are the native <span class="ph uicontrol">Settings</span> and
				<span class="ph uicontrol">E-Mail</span> applications of iOS and Android tablets. This pattern
			can be used with the <code>SplitApp</code> control.</p><p>The figure shows the basic idea of the pattern. The app is divided into two views, the master
			and the detail view. The master view presents a list of items and is used as the main
			navigation within the application. The detail view shows detail information for the
			selected item.</p><img src="loio613a3fe6daf6423094b47cf85bd2e1e5_LowRes.png" alt="SAPUI5 Mobile SplitApp Pattern" usemap="#"><p>Whereas the selection of an item on a mobile devices navigates the user to the detail
			page, the user can see the list of items and the detail view at the same time on a
			tablet device. </p><p>If the tablet device is used in portrait mode it has less available width space. For this, the
				<code>SplitApp</code> control provides three different modes for displaying the
			master and detail view in portrait mode:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p><b>ShowHideMode</b></p>
				<p>This is the default mode. This mode hides the master view automatically when the user turns
					the device into portrait mode. To display the master view, the user swipes right
					on the detail view or uses the button which is placed on the header of the
					detail view. </p>
				<p>The Master view slides in from the left hand side. The user can choose another list item
					which will update the detail view and automatically hides the master view
					again.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p><b>PopoverMode</b></p>
				<p>This mode places the master view inside a popover which can be opened via the button in the
					header of the detail view.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p><b>StretchCompressMode</b></p>
				<p>This mode displays the master view in both, the portrait and the landscape mode. In portrait
					mode, the detail view has less space available.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><p>In landscape mode, all three modes described above display the master view.</p><p>If you run a <code>SplitApp</code> on a mobile device, it automatically behaves like
			a standard mobile application. The following figure shows the difference: </p><img src="loio7de0375279414783a77e7b4811661f34_LowRes.png" alt="SAPUI5 Mobile Splitt App Mobile" usemap="#"><p>As only one page per screen can be displayed, the master and detail view are automatically
			displayed on separate pages and the standard page navigation is applied.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
