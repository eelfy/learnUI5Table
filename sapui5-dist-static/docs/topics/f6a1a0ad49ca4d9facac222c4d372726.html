Complex web pages may
		therefore have a negative impact on the application performance. This also depends on the
		mobile device and affects most likely the sap.m.List and
			sap.m.Table controls.</div><p>These controls are often bound to data sources and often dynamically generate list items or
			table rows. The data may contain a large number of elements. Apart from the performance,
			creating long lists or tables on mobile devices also affects usability: navigating
			through large data sets on a mobile device is less convenient than on the desktop. We
			recommend to restrict the number of elements in lists or tables to 100 on mobile
			devices.</p><p>If a list contains too many items, the device needs more time for rendering and the user has to
			wait before he can see the list or table on the device. The scrolling behavior may also
			be affected. To reduce the number of items that must be rendered initially, you can use
			the <code>growing</code> feature for the list or table. With this feature,
			subsequent loads will not trigger a rerendering of the complete list and are more
			performant. However, if a re-rendering of the entire list is triggered for another
			reason, the rendering may have a reduced performance. </p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
