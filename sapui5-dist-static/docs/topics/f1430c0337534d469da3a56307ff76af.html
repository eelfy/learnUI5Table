			<p> UI adaptation is a feature of SAPUI5 flexibility that allows key users without
				technical knowledge to easily make UI changes for all users of an app, end users to personalize controls, and developers to extend the
				UIs of SAPUI5 applications.

			<h2 class="title ">Very important: Use stable IDs</h2>
			<p>Stable IDs are used to identify the controls that can be changed via UI adaptation or personalization. For this reason, every control
				and view that you use must have a stable ID. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/f51dbb78e7d5448e838cdc04bdf65403.html" title="Stable IDs are IDs for controls, elements, or components that you set yourself in the respective id property or attribute as opposed to IDs that are generated by SAPUI5. Stable means that the IDs are concatenated with the application component ID and do not have any auto-generated parts." class="sap-doc">Stable IDs: All You Need to Know</a>. Here,
				you also find information on how to check if all your IDs are stable.</p>
			<p>If your app is based on SAP Fiori elements, it automatically generates IDs for
				its controls. You only have to set stable IDs if you use extension points to modify it, for example to add an additional view.</p>
			<div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>Never change the IDs when you're creating the next version of your app if the app was already delivered. Otherwise you'd risk

			<p>More than 60 controls, such as forms, pages, tool bars and input elements support UI adaptation, and the number is growing. </p>

			<h2 class="title ">Stashed-based lazy loading: Load your views asynchronously</h2>
			<p>If you use stashing to load pages (<code>stashed=true</code>), you need to load your views asynchronously. Otherwise key user changes will
				get lost as soon as the app is reloaded. Asynchronous loading is a good idea anyway to improve the performance of your app, but make
				sure that asynchronicity is in place when you use stashing. For more information, see the <a href="#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader" title="#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader">API Reference for <code>sap.uxap.ObjectPageLazyLoader</code></a>
				 as well as <a href="#/topic/68d0e58857a647d49470d9f92dd859bd.html" title="To instantiate views asychronously, SAPUI5 provides the factory method View.create defined in module sap/ui/core/mvc/View." class="sap-doc">Instantiating Views</a></p>
		</section><section id="section_ControllerCode">
			<h2 class="title ">Controller Code</h2>
			<p>Normally, UI changes should win over binding and application coding. However, there is no distinct point in time when all controls are
				available. This consequently means that there is also no single event when all changes have been applied, because, for example, new
				changes can be introduced through user interactions.</p>
			<p>The following mechanisms ensure that changes usually win over application coding:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">For controls in the XML view, changes are applied during the XML view processing.</li>
					<li class="li">For controls that are created by your controller code, for example controls that are part of a group and are later placed inside an existing
						control, the changes are applied when the control is added to the SAPUI5 control tree.</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>However, with too many complexities or dynamics in the controller code, you can inadvertently overrule changes done by the key user.
				Example: If a key user removes (i.e., hides) a control and your controller code overwrites its visibility property afterwards, the key
				user change doesn't have an effect. If you cannot avoid this case because of some app-specific reasons, you should at least restrict
				the availability of certain actions as described under <a href="#/topic/de9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4.html#loiode9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4/section_restrictadaptation" title="de9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4.xml#loiode9fd55c69af4b46863f5d26b5d796c4/section_restrictadaptation" class="sap-doc">Restrict Adaptation for Certain Controls</a>.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind that the positions of controls can change if the key user moves them on the UI. Controls might end up in different
				aggregations and at different index positions from what you specified. Therefore, you should only access controls by their ID. </p>
			<p>
				</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you access <code>ObjectPageSections</code> and controls within <code>ObjectPageSections</code>, they might be stashed after the
					key user removes them. In this case, the stashed control (i.e. the <code>ObjectPageSection</code>) will remain as an empty
					placeholder, but any controls within the stashed control will be removed. This means that the control is not processed and
					therefore not instantiated. Your code shouldn’t break in this case.</p></div></div>
			<p></p>
			<p>It's okay to create additional controls dynamically, for example, as a result of user interaction. If you dynamically add controls to
				the UI, make sure to set all properties before you add them to an aggregation of a parent control, ideally as part of the constructor.
				With this, you prevent that changes that key user made to the control are overridden.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">How can I change my app without breaking the key user's changes?</h2>
			<p>In general, you can change your app without any problems, as long as you keep the following in mind:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">Don’t change control IDs. If you change control IDs, the app will still start, but any existing changes related to this ID
						will not be applied anymore.</li>
					<li class="li">Don’t change view hierarchies, because the control IDs depend on the view IDs or fragment IDs.</li>
					<li class="li">Don’t remove controls that had a stable ID before.</li>
