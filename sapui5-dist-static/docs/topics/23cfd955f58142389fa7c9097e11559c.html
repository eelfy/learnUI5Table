			<h2 class="title ">Project Setup</h2>
			<p>Before you start developing apps with SAPUI5, you start by setting up the
				development environment of your choice. You can find our recommendations under <a href="#/topic/7bb04e05f9484e1b95b38a2e48ecef4f.html" title="This part of the documentation introduces you to some common and recommended use cases for the installation, configuration, and setup of SAPUI5 development environments." class="sap-doc">Development Environment</a>.</p>
			<p>After that, you define the project setup. If you work in a team, we recommend using a continuous integration setup as described under
					<a href="#/topic/fe7a158313af4590ad60f844e5b43b80.html" title="This section describes the setup of a development project where multiple developers work together on the same code." class="sap-doc">Continuous Integration: Ensure Code Quality</a>. If you work alone, you should at the very least set up an automated testing
				environment.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Development</h2>
			<p>When faced with developing an app, you have several ways to get started ranging from app templates or a make-em-completely-from-scratch
				approach. But which approach is right for your situation? In most cases, it's your level of expertise or need for flexibility and
				freedom that will decide.</p>
			<p>Think of the app templates described in this section as a kind of best practice for app development. They incorporate our latest
				recommendations and can be used as a starting point for developing apps according to the SAP Fiori design guidelines. They include generic application functionality and tests
				that can be easily extended with custom functionality if needed. There are separate templates for Worklist and Master-Detail
				application patterns, and we have an empty basic template. The templates are described under <a href="#/topic/a460a7348a6c431a8bd967ab9fb8d918.html" title="The app templates documented here are a kind of &quot;best practice&quot; for your app development." class="sap-doc">App Templates: Kick Start Your App Development</a>.</p>
			<p>If you're skilled at coding and want the freedom and flexibility, you can build an app completely from scratch. In the chapters in this
				section, you will find some guidance on how to deal with crucial concepts such as accessibility, security, device adaptation.</p>
			<p>Be sure to check out information about things that you really should avoid doing while coding: <a href="#/topic/387787232c214b42954f18c93a28560a.html" title="This section lists some of the most important issues that should be avoided when creating applications using SAPUI5, split into different categories for reasons of simplicity." class="sap-doc">Coding Issues to Avoid</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also use SAP Fiori elements or the reuse components of Analysis Path Framework. For more
				information, see <a href="#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd.html" title="This section contains information about developing SAP Fiori apps using SAP Fiori elements." class="sap-doc">Developing Apps with SAP Fiori Elements</a> and <a href="#/topic/1c457c53595a6655e10000000a423f68.html" title="Analysis Path Framework (APF) provides reuse components that allow you to build and enhance interactive analytical Web applications." class="sap-doc">Developing Apps with Analysis Path Framework (APF)</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Packaging and Deployment</h2>
			<p>How you deploy your app when you're finished depends on the tools you use and the platform where your app is going to run. See the
				related documentation for details.</p>
			<p>For example, it's quite easy to deploy an app to SAP Business Technology Platform with SAP Business Application Studio. For more information about SAP Business Application Studio, see the documentation on the SAP Help Portal at <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/Cloud/en-US" title="https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/Cloud/en-US" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP Business Application Studio</a>.</p>
