		owner.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Routes</h2>
			<p>Each route defines a name, a pattern, and optionally one or more targets to which to navigate when the route has been matched. In the
					<code>routes</code> section, you define which patterns are available for navigation.</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <code>name</code> of the route (unique within one router instance)</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <code>pattern</code> as hash part of the URL that matches the route</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The navigation <code>target</code> as defined in the <code>targets</code> section</p>
					<p>If you want to load multiple views/components at the same time, you can assign multiple
						targets (see <a href="#/topic/2c5c84d207d246bc9f733f29df1ff892.html" title="If you want to navigate to multiple targets with the same hash, you can either assign multiple targets to a route, or define a parent for the target." class="sap-doc">Working with Multiple Targets</a>). </p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>If a target is configured for loading a component, you can enable the routing
						in the loaded component, see <a href="#/topic/fb19f501b16e4e4991eb6a017770945b.html" title="Every SAPUI5 component can define routing configuration in its manifest and a UI5 router instance will be created automatically after the component is instantiated." class="sap-doc">Enabling Routing in Nested Components</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The <code>titleTarget</code> to specify from which target the title is taken when multiple targets are displayed. If no
							<code>titleTarget</code> is defined, the first target that has a <code>title</code> is chosen  (see <a href="#/topic/1238d706b130433c9bd6b85cfb77cece.html" title="Routing in SAPUI5 allows you to define titles declaratively in the configuration. The title can be set with valid binding syntax which is then resolved under the scope of the target to which it belongs. This means that the title can be translated when it’s bound to the i18n model or resolved dynamically under the current binding context." class="sap-doc">Using the title Property in Targets</a>).</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sequence of the routes in the <code>routes</code> definition is important. As soon as a pattern is matched, the following patterns are
				ignored. To prevent this for a specific route, you use the <code>greedy</code> parameter. If set to <code>true</code>, the route is
				always taken into account.</p>

						<code>sap.m.routing.Router</code></a>.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Targets</h2>
			<p>A target defines the view or component that is displayed. It is associated with one or more
				routes or it can be displayed manually from within the app. Whenever a target is
				displayed, the corresponding view or component is loaded and added to the
				aggregation configured with the <code>controlAggregation</code> option of the
				control. The target definition can contain the following parameters:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>The target key</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>type</code> to specify whether the target is a view or a
							component</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>name</code> to specify the name of the view or
							component</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Additional optional parameters</p>
						<p>If you don't specify a parameter, the default value is taken from the
								<code>config</code> section.</p><ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>viewType</code> (e.g. <code>XML</code>) which
										is valid only when the <code>type</code> is set to
										"View"</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>id</code> of the view or component instance</p>
									<p>A view or component instance is cached in SAPUI5 routing under the combination of its
											<code>name</code> and <code>id</code>. If there
										already is one instance created for a specific view or
										component with an <code>id</code>, this instance is
										reused if another target with the same <code>name</code>
										and <code>id</code> is displayed. If a new instance
										needs to be created instead of reusing the existing ones,
										assign the target a different <code>id</code>.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>viewLevel</code>
									</p>
									<p>You can use different levels to define the navigation direction,for example the
										navigation from a lower view level to a higher view level
										leads to forward navigation. This is, for example, important
										for <code>flip</code> and <code>slide</code>
										transitions, where the slide animation should go from left
										to right or vice versa.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>controlId</code> of the control that is used as the
										parent to insert the view or component (e.g.
											<code>app</code>)</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>controlAggregation</code> target aggregation of the
										control with <code>controlId</code> to which the view or
										component  is added</p>
									<p>The <code>NavContainer</code> control, for example, has
										an aggregation called <code>Pages</code> and the shell
										container has <code>Content</code>.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>parent</code>: the key of another target which a
										view is created and added before the target view or
										component is added</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>path</code>: the namespace of the view or
										component</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>targetParent</code> where the control with the
											<code>controlId</code> is located (see <a href="#/topic/2c5c84d207d246bc9f733f29df1ff892.html" title="If you want to navigate to multiple targets with the same hash, you can either assign multiple targets to a route, or define a parent for the target." class="sap-doc">Working with Multiple Targets</a>); this
										option is set automatically for the root view of a component
										if the router instance is instantiated by the component.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>clearAggregation</code> specifies whether the
										aggregation should be cleared before adding the new view
										instance.</p>
									<p>When you use the <code>sap.m.routing.Router</code> the
										default is <code>false</code>, for
											<code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router</code> it is
											<code>true</code>.</p>
									<p>When using <code>sap.ui.ux3.Shell</code> this value
										should be set to <code>true</code>, for
											<code>sap.m.NavContainer</code> to
											<code>false</code> to ensure that the correct
										content is shown.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>transition</code> defines how the transition
										happens; you can choose between <code>slide</code>
										(default), <code>flip</code>, <code>fade</code>, and
											<code>show</code>.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">
									<p><code>title</code> contains either a static text or a
										valid binding syntax, e.g. to an i18n model, which is
										resolved under the binding context of the view (see <a href="#/topic/1238d706b130433c9bd6b85cfb77cece.html" title="Routing in SAPUI5 allows you to define titles declaratively in the configuration. The title can be set with valid binding syntax which is then resolved under the scope of the target to which it belongs.

			<h2 class="title ">Config</h2>
			<p>The <code>config</code> section contains the global router configuration and default values that apply for all routes and targets. The
					<code>config</code> section contains the following settings. </p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>routerClass</code> defines which router is used.</p>
						<p>You can either use class <code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router</code> (default) or <code>sap.m.routing.Router</code>. If you use a
								<code>sap.m</code> control (such as <code>NavContainer</code> or <code>SplitApp</code>) in your app, you can benefit
							more from using <code>sap.m.routing.Router</code> because it not only loads the targets and places them in the corresponding
							container, but also triggers the animation for navigating to the right target.</p>
						<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
							</p><p>The possible values for <code>routerClass</code> are <code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router</code>,
									<code>sap.m.routing.Router</code>, or any other subclasses of <code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router</code>.</p>
							<p>Compared to <code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router</code>, the <code>sap.m.routing.Router</code> is optimized for mobile apps
								and adds the properties <code>viewLevel</code>, <code>transition</code>, and <code>transitionParameters</code> which
								can be specified for each route or target created by the <code>sap.m.routing.Router</code>. The
									<code>transitionParameters</code> can also be used for custom transitions. See the <span class="ph uicontrol">API Reference</span>
								for more information.</p>
						<p></p></div></div>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <code>homeRoute</code> defines the route whose target title is inserted as the
							first entry in the title history in the <code>titleChanged</code>
							event or in the return value of
								<code>sap.ui.core.routing.Router.prototype.getTitleHistory</code>.
							For more information, see section <span class="ph uicontrol">Initial title of the home

						<p>The property contains the <code>name</code> of one of the routes that
							are defined in the <code>routes</code> section as value.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>You can also define default values for all target parameters </p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>async</code> defines whether targets are loaded asynchronously;
							the default value is <code>false</code>. We recommend setting this
							parameter to <code>true</code> to improve performance.</p>

							</p><p>If you use asynchronous loading, you cannot rely on the sequence of events that are fired during the load phase. If you follow
								our programming model with MVC, this should not be a problem.</p>
						<p></p></div></div>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Using the <code>bypassed</code> parameter, you specify the navigation target that is used whenever no navigation pattern is
							matched. If you use this setting, you also have to define a corresponding target in the <code>targets</code> section.</p>

		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Owner</h2>
			<p>The <code>owner</code> parameter defines the owner of all views that are created by the router. This is typically a
