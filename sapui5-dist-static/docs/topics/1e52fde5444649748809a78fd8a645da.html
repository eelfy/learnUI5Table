If you use SAP Business Application Studio, for example, a breakpoint set in SAP Business Application Studio does <b>not</b> stop your script when it is executed in your
			browser, unless you use the <code>debugger;</code> statement explicitly in your code. The browser does not know about your IDE and
			does not communicate directly with it.</p><section><h2 class="title ">ABAP Debugger vs. Browser Debugger</h2><p>This section explains how you use the
				debugging tool of a Chrome browser. Keep in mind that you have to test your
				application on all browsers that are officially supported by SAP, because the
				implementation differs depending on the browser used, see <a href="#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933.html" title="Browser and platform support for the SAPUI5 libraries on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms." class="sap-doc">Choose your Browser</a>. To
				start the debugger, use the browser menu or choose <kbd class="ph userinput">F12</kbd> (valid
				for most browsers).</p><p>The following explanations assume that your application is
				up and running on your web server, either a local Tomcat, or a remote
				server.</p><p>In a first step, locate the lines of code you would like to inspect
				and set breakpoints. The following figure shows an application that is opened in the
				Chrome debugger. The default tab <span class="ph uicontrol">Elements</span> is opened, and a
				small bell icon with a number located at the right border of the footer indicates
				the number of messages from the console.</p><img src="loio1b9ea07a3ea7448aade495df4add5fd1_LowRes.jpg" usemap="#"><p>On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Elements</span> tab, the HTML elements of the DOM are
				displayed in a tree structure. To see the JavaScript code within the application and
				to set a breakpoint there, open the <span class="ph uicontrol">Sources</span> tab. From there,
				you can open any source files that is included. When you open the tools the first
				time, you ususally have to click the arrow icon on the left hand side of the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Sources</span> tab (as indicated in the following figure) to
				open the sources tree.</p><img src="loio2eec3c2d87394dfeb04b1ac0dcbc1016_LowRes.jpg" usemap="#"><p>To see the actual content of the HTML page and to set a breakpoint, open the
				HTML page from the sources tree. This is similar to the ABAP debugger when you
				execute and debug an application from the workbench. The following figures show the
				ABAP workbench debugger and the Chrome debugger.</p><p>The following figure shows
				the ABAP workbench debugger. The bubbles indicate the opened application and its
				location (1), the call stack (2), and the tab where you enter the variables you want
				to watch (3).</p><img src="loio44b5f9fdc2ab43d6a6f162304a65b54d_LowRes.jpg" usemap="#"><p>The next figure shows the Chrome debugger. Here, the bubbles indicate the
				script you are looking at (1), the watch expressions where you can add the variables
				you want to watch (3), the call stack that indicates if the code execution stops on
				a breakpoint (2), and the breakpoint (4). The call stack is only visible when the
				code execution is on hold.</p><img src="loioc9721fb27743420fab54764291db1b04_LowRes.jpg" usemap="#"><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

				</p><p>JavaScript does not support a forward navigation, meaning that you can not jump
					to a method by double clicking. Instead, you either have to jump to the method
					during execution, or you open the file containing the method. </p>
			<p></p></div></div><p>If you are not sure in which file exactly a piece of code is located, Firefox
				offers you an option to search through several files included in your page. Chrome,
				however, does <b>not</b> support this option. </p></section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Setting Breakpoints</h2>
			<p>The browser debugger supports several options for setting breakpoints. You can, for example,
				click once on the line number where you would like to break. To remove the
				breakpoint, click the respective line again. To temporarily disable or edit the
				breakpoint, right click on an existing breakpoint. To set a conditional breakpoint,
				right click on a line without breakpoint. You can also set breakpoints on a certain
				event or event listeners, see the option in the lower right screen area of the
				figure above. For more information, see the tutorials for your respective browser
				that are available in the internet. </p>

				</p><p>In most cases after setting a breakpoint, you have to reload the page to execute the code
					again and to make it stop at the respective line.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Adding Variables to Watch</h2>
			<p>To add a variable to the list of watched variables, open the context menu for the variable in
				the code line and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Add to watch</span>. Another option is to
				choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">+</span> button at the top of the watch list to add a new
				line, in which you can then enter the name of the variable you want to watch.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Modifying Variables</h2>
			<p>If you want to modify a variable to find out if the code works correctly with a different
				value, open the console, for example by choosing <kbd class="ph userinput">ESC</kbd> in the
				debugging tool and enter the new value manually directly in the JavaScript code. To
				confirm the change, choose <kbd class="ph userinput">ENTER</kbd> in Chrome and
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Execute</span> in Firefox. </p>

			<h2 class="title ">Stepping Through Executed Code</h2>
			<p>In ABAP, a yellow arrow indicates the line of code that is currently being executed. In
				Chrome, the arrow is red and the code line is highlighted. The following table gives
				an overview of the function keys for the ABAP workbench and Java Script: </p>
