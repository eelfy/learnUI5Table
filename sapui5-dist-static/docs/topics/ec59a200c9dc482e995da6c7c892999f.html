			quite a few features of the smart controls aside. For example, the
				<code>SmartTable</code> control can also be used in combination with the
			so-called analytical table, a table type that has additional features, such as
			displaying aggregation rows to display the sums. This information is controlled by the
			configuration in the <code>metadata.xml</code> document. In addition, the
				<code>SmartField</code> control as a basic building block can consume more
			annotations than we have been able to show here.</p><p>We would also like to mention that the OData services you have seen in this tutorial have
			version 2.0.
			With
			version 4.0, the behavior might change.</p><p>In the previous steps you have seen how smart controls can use different sources of
			configuration to make development easier. You may wonder, though, where exactly which
			configuration should be located. To answer this question, we need to think about from
			where the various configuration parts are coming. You should think of
				<code>metadata.xml</code> (that is the definition of entities, such as
				<code>EntityType</code> and annotations) as information associated with the
			service or the application logic, even though we have seen that annotations are more
			UI-specific than the more generic information found in the <code>EntityTypes</code>
			and the <code>EntityContainer</code>. Information in the
				<code>metadata.xml</code> is therefore predetermined for a certain amount of
			reuse: You can build several UIs (or parts of it) reusing this information. We have seen
			such a reuse several times in this document: The reuse of the OData service metadata
			document for <code>SmartFilterBar</code>, <code>SmartTable</code>, and the
			popups associated with the value help. In contrast to this, the configuration
			information that we specify in the <code>view.xml</code> is more specific to one
			concrete UI.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong><a href="topic/64bde9a8879d4f418e2849f7285dd757">Smart Controls</a></div><div class="previousLink"><br><strong>Previous: </strong><a href="topic/0219b115deda45a9ae46d11fdc7e69eb">Step 9: Smart Chart with Chart Personalization and View Management</a></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
