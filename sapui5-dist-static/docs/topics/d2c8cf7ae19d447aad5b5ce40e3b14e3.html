			<p>SAPUI5 provides the following predefined models. For an overview of the
				binding modes supported by them, see <a href="#/topic/68b9644a253741e8a4b9e4279a35c247.html#loio68b9644a253741e8a4b9e4279a35c247/section_BindingModes" title="68b9644a253741e8a4b9e4279a35c247.xml#loio68b9644a253741e8a4b9e4279a35c247/section_BindingModes" class="sap-doc">One-time Binding, One-way Binding, and Two-way Binding</a>.</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">OData model</span>: Enables binding of controls to data from OData services. The OData model supports two-way,
						one-way and one-time binding modes. However, two-way binding is currently only supported for properties, and not for
						aggregations.</p>
					<p>

							<ul class="ul ">
								<li class="li">
									<p>OData V2</p>
								</li>
								<li class="li">OData V4 (limited feature scope)</li>
							</ul>

					<p></p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">JSON model</span>: Can be used to bind controls to JavaScript object data, which is usually serialized in the
						JSON format. The JSON model is a client-side model and, therefore, intended for small data sets, which are completely
						available on the client. The JSON model supports two-way (default), one-way and one-time binding modes.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">XML model</span>: A client-side model intended for small data sets, which are completely available on the client.
						The XML model does not contain mechanisms for server-based paging or loading of deltas. The XML model supports two-way
						(default), one-way and one-time binding modes.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Resource model</span>: Designed to handle data in resource bundles, mainly to provide texts in different
						languages. The resource model only supports one-time binding mode because it deals with static texts only.</p>
				</li>
			</ul><p>The JSON model, XML model, and the resource model are <span class="emphasis">client-side models</span>, meaning that the model data is
				loaded completely and is available on the client. Operations such as sorting and filtering are executed on the client without further
				server requests. </p><p>The OData (V2 or V4) model is a <span class="emphasis">server-side model</span> and only loads the data requested by
				the user interface from the server.</p><p>You can not only define one model for your applications, but define different areas in your
				application with different models and assign single controls to a model. You can also define nested models, for example, a JSON model
				defined for the application and an OData model for a table control contained in the application. </p><p>A Web application should
				support several data sources, such as JSON, XML, Atom, or OData. However, the way in which data binding is defined and implemented
				within the UI controls should be independent of the respective data source. It is also possible to create a custom model
				implementation for data sources that are not yet covered by the framework or are domain-specific.</p></section><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig">
