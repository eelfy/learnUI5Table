			<h2 class="title ">The Initial App</h2>
			<p>With the downloaded code, you now have the bulletin board prototype, set up according to the
					SAPUI5 best
				practices. The prototype provides the common features of an SAPUI5 app. If you have
				completed the Walkthrough tutorial, you should be familiar with most of the source
				code in this step. Additional features of the app are:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Entry Page</span></p>
					<p>In this tutorial, we will often switch between testing application features manually, and
						running automated tests. The <code>webapp/test/test.html</code> file
						provides a list of entry points for the app so that you do not have to enter
						the URLs manually. From this page you can open the app with mock data, run
						the unit tests, run the integration tests, or run the app’s test suite (this
						will be added later in the tutorial). Note that in a productive scenario we
						would have an additional entry point that calls the app with a real service.
						At this stage we are working with mock data and don't have a real service
						for our prototype yet, so we have left this step out.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Home Page</span></p>
					<p>The home page of our bulletin board app is the
							<code>webapp/test/mockServer.html</code> file. On this page, we
						initialize SAPUI5, start the mock server, and instantiate our app component. It consists of
						a single view that displays a list of posts from a bulletin board with
						several attributes in a table.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>We do not yet have a real service for
							the bulletin board prototype so run the app with mock data and this test
							page throughout the tutorial. The mock server helps by mimicking a real
							service and it processes requests with a small delay, just as a real
							service would. This is perfect for realistic application testing and is
							also helpful for local development tests. It is a good practice to put
							all test pages in the test folder of the app, so that they are clearly
							separated from the productive coding.</p></div></div><p></p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Data</span></p>
					<p>In the <code>webapp/localService/</code> folder, you can find the metadata and the
						mock data for the app. The <code>metadata.xml</code> file is used by
						the mock server to simulate real back-end service calls in the app. It
						describes our OData service and you can replace it later with a real
						service. The service we use has
						a
						single OData entity:</p><ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Post</span></p>
								<p>A post consists of typical properties like
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Title</span>,
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Description</span>, and
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Price</span>. Each post is assigned to a
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Category</span> and a
										<span class="ph uicontrol">Contact</span>. The entity can be identified
									with its ID property: <code>PostID</code>. The corresponding
										<code>EntitySet</code> is <code>Posts</code>. </p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Category</span></p>
								<p>In our example, the category only has a <code>Name</code>
									property. Posts are sorted into a category by the category name.
									The corresponding <code>EntitySet</code> is
										<code>Categories</code>.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Comment</span></p>
								<p>A comment has an <code>Author</code>, a
									<code>Date</code>, and a <code>CommentText</code>
									property. The entity can be identified by the
										<code>CommentID</code> property and is linked to a
										<code>post</code> by the <code>ParentID</code>. The
									corresponding <code>EntitySet</code> is
										<code>Comments</code>.</p>
							</li>
						</ul><p></p>
					<p>The actual test data containing several mock posts is located in the
							<code>webapp/test/service/posts.json</code> file.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Testing Functionality</span></p>
					<p>The team that created the first prototype already took care of the basic test setup.
						Everything required for application testing is shipped with SAPUI5 and can
						simply be used within the app. The testing infrastructure is set up in the
							<code>test</code> folder that is located in the
							<code>webapp</code> folder of the app:</p><ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Mock Server</span></p>
								<p>The mock server is set up in the <code>webapp/localService/mockserver.js</code>
									file. It loads the metadata and the mock data in the same
									folder. Using the mock server allows us to run the app easily
									and show realistic data for testing, even without a network
									connection and without the need of having a remote server for
									our application data.</p>
								<p>There is a configurable delay for each request that is processed by the mock server that
									allows you to mimick a slow back-end server.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Unit Tests</span></p>
								<p>All unit tests are located in the <code>webapp/test/unit</code> folder and can be
									started by calling the <code>unitTests.qunit.html</code>
									file in the same folder. Initially, there are only a few tests
									for model instantiation and formatters that cover basic
									functionality in the prototype. We will give you more details
									about the unit test setup later in the tutorial.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Integration Tests</span></p>
								<p>Integration tests are written in OPA5 – a tool for integration testing that is included
									in SAPUI5 – and can be found in the
										<code>webapp/test/integration</code> folder. You can
									start all OPA5 tests by calling the
										<code>opaTests.qunit.html</code> file in the same
									folder. OPA5 tests are organized in test journeys, and we have
									included a worklist journey that checks if the table of posts is
									displayed properly. We will give you more details about the
									integration test setup later in the tutorial.</p>
							</li>
						</ul><p></p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p><span class="emphasis">Other quality-related features of the app</span></p>
					<p>The app is set up according to best practices and already contains many helpful features.
							</p><ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Separation of concerns (MVC)</span></p>
								<p>All artifacts are located in either the <code>model</code>, <code>view</code>, or <code>controller</code> folder of
									the app. The app’s component and its descriptor configure which of those MVC artifacts to load. This configuration
									controls the navigation flow of the app.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Separation of productive and nonproductive
										code</span></p>
								<p>All nonproductive code is located in the
										<code>test</code> subfolder. This includes the unit
									and integration tests, and the test page to call the app with
									mock data. All productive code is located in the
										<code>webapp</code> folder. This clearly separates
									the test artifacts from the application coding and makes it easy
									to remove all test-related artifacts before deploying the app
									for productive use.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p><span class="emphasis">Busy handling</span></p>
								<p>As a best practice, you should always give users instant feedback
									when triggering actions and navigating in the app. The app
									already includes functionality to display a busy indication when
									data is loaded or actions are triggered. To simulate a slow
									backend and show the behavior of the app, the mock server is
									configured with a delay of one second for each request.</p>
							</li>
						</ul><p></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have a running prototype, we can further extend it with additional tests and
				features. Make sure that the app is running by calling the test page, the unit
				tests, and the integration tests from the entry page
					<code>webapp/test/test.html</code>. The app should display a list of
				bulletin board posts as seen in the screenshot above and the tests should run
				without errors.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Test Strategy</h2>
			<p>Let’s first take a look at best practices for testing apps written in SAPUI5. JavaScript is a
				dynamic programming language and only some issues can be detected by static code
				check tools and manual testing. Automated tests that execute the code regularly are
				beneficial for good quality and development productivity – especially when you're
				developing in short development cycles.</p>
			<p>We expect our prototype to be released and shipped as a product soon, so we need a solid
				testing strategy. Fortunately the prototype team has already thought ahead and
				prepared an infrastructure for unit and integration testing that is included in the
				app. This is a really good starting point for further enhancements of the app.</p>
			<p>The mock server is also set up and allows us to test the app with local test data
				instead of a real back-end service. We can use the mock data for writing reliable
				integration tests that do not depend on another system which might be unavailable
				when the tests are run.</p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>If you start developing an app from scratch, you should always consider testing from the
				very beginning of the software life cycle. Nobody wants to write tests for
				undocumented code and make assumptions about the logic. It is worth the effort to
				think about code checks, unit and integration testing, and a solid testing strategy
				from the very start.</p></div></div>
			<p>Before you start implementing your first test, you should think about how to test the
				different aspects of your application. The image below shows the testing tools along
				the agile testing pyramid.</p>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="loio88758c3b4ad94e9ca6508d106fe66972_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div><span class="collapsible-icon sap-icon figcap title">Testing pyramid</span></div>
			<p>When you set up application testing, you should automate as many testing steps as possible. If
				you immediately write a test for all the features that we implement, then you can
				greatly reduce manual testing efforts that are time consuming and cumbersome. If you
				change something later, you can simply run the existing tests and see if the
				functionality is still working as expected.</p>
			<p>SAPUI5 comes with two testing
				tools: QUnit for unit testing and OPA5 for integration testing. The unit tests are
				the foundation of our testing pyramid and they should validate the most important
				logic of our app. In addition, you can write integration tests for more
				interaction-related functionality, such as interacting with UI elements of the app. </p>
			<p>There might still be features that are hard to test with these client-side testing frameworks.
				Certain features might require a more sophisticated system test, such as a
				screenshot comparison that can be implemented with additional testing frameworks.
				And of course, you should also schedule manual tests (for example, browser,
				performance, or security tests) to make sure that the app is behaving as expected. </p>
