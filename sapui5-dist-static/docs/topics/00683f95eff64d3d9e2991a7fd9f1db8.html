		preview of content from an application for which they have the proper
		authorization.</div><p>An overview page provides a wide overview to the end user so that they can look at and
			interact with business data in a specific domain. A user can perform key actions such as
			clicking on a particular card and navigating to another application. But what if the
			user does an intent-based navigation to another application and gets an error because
			they're not authorized to access that application? </p><p>To improve this user experience, during card configuration, you can add the property
				<code>requireAppAuthorization</code> in the <code>manifest.json</code>
			file. Once a user has entered an app, this property is checked against
				<code>isIntentSupported</code> to see if the user has the required
			authorizations to access the app. If so, then the card will be displayed. The advantage
			here is that the intent can be set explicitly as needed.</p><p>Also, <code>isIntentSupported</code> is standard functionality in the Cross
			Application Navigation Service. </p><div class="note other samplecode "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
