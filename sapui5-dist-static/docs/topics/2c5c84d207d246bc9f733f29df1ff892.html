		multiple targets to a route, or define a parent for the target.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Multiple Targets for the Same Route</h2>
			<p>In the routing configuration, you can add multiple targets for the same route.</p>
			<p>All target view or component instances are created and loaded in the order that they appear in
				the target option of a route when the pattern is matched.</p>
			<p>If you add multiple targets to a route, this builds a connection between the targets on the route level only. The targets can still be displayed
				separately if needed. Use this approach when the connection between the targets is only needed  in some routes, but not always.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Parent Relationship</h2>
			<p>You can also define a parent for a target in the target definition. For the parent, you also create an entry in the <code>targets</code>
				configuration, but you don't have to create a corresponding route.</p>
			<p>Whenever a target has a parent, an instance of the parent is always created before an instance of the target is created.</p>
			<p>A parent relationship between targets tightly couples the two targets together. The parent target is always displayed before the child target is
				displayed. The child target can't be displayed without first displaying the parent target. This approach is mainly used when the view in the
				child target is added to an aggregation of the view in the parent target. </p>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>There is also a <code>parent</code> property for the <code>route</code>. This
					property is only used when its parent exists in a parent component of the
					current component (see <a href="#/topic/fb19f501b16e4e4991eb6a017770945b.html" title="Every SAPUI5 component can define routing configuration in its manifest and a UI5 router instance will be created automatically after the component is instantiated." class="sap-doc">Enabling Routing in Nested Components</a>).
					For all other types of parent-child relationships, either use multiple targets
					or a parent relationship in targets.</p>

			<p>In the following example, the relationship between the views <code>employeeOverviewTop</code> and <code>employeeOverviewContent</code> is
				established by assigning both to the same route.</p>
			<p>The relationship between the target <code>employeeOverview</code> and <code>employeeOverviewTop</code>
					(<code>employeeOverviewContent</code> respectively) is a parent relationship.</p>

When the button is pressed, a new page opens that contains two parts: a header part at the top and a content part. The content part displays a table of employees that can be sorted and searched. We will use the array notation in the routing configuration to assign multiple targets to a route - a feature that we have not yet introduced." class="sap-doc">Step 11: Assign Multiple Targets</a>.</p>
