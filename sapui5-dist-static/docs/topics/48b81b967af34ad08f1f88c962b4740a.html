This
		feature is currently only enabled for XML views. On an abstract level, preprocessing means
		that a view can be modified during runtime before it is rendered. This makes it possible to
		use the templating syntax, as it is interpreted by the preprocessor. It also makes it
		possible to apply user customization.</div><p>The following figure shows the different stages of view initialization. There are three
			hooks, XML, ViewXML and controls, which differ mainly in the source that is passed to
			the preprocessor.</p><img src="loiof33daeb55f54422ebe67ec9b13d74447_LowRes.png" usemap="#"><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>XML</p>
				<p>The raw view source in the XML format is passed to the preprocessor. This enables
					example templating on XML level.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>ViewXML</p>
				<p>The raw view source with all XML preprocessing results gets enhanced with its
					full IDs for the controls and passed on to the preprocessor. Adaptions on a
					valid view source can now be made before the XML is being parsed into a control
					tree.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Controls</p>
				<p>The view source is already processed to the JavaScript object and the control
					tree is available. This enables you to make changes to the view after design
					time, like special customizations, stored at some persistence layer or similar,
					the user has made previously. Or customizations depending on the user role which
					are not applicable during design time.</p>
			</li>

			<h2 class="title ">Using the Preprocessor</h2>
			<p>First, you need a preprocessor implementation. SAPUI5 provides a default preprocessor
				for XML templating which can be enabled by default. You can also build your own
				preprocessor based on the <code>Preprocessor</code> interface. For more information, see
					the <a href="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor" title="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.View.Preprocessor">API Reference</a> and the <a href="#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.View.preprocessor/preview" title="#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.View.preprocessor/preview" class="sap-doc" alt="#/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.View.preprocessor/preview">sample</a> in the Demo Kit.
				</p>
			<p>To use the preprocessor, you can choose one of the following options:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>Global availability</p>
					<p>Makes the preprocessor available to all XML views and processes it every time
						a View is initialized. This maybe the right case for essential operations
						you want to apply to every view in your application. Therefore you can make
						use of the <code>registerPreprocessor</code> method: </p>
					<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// "XMLView" required from module "sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView"
XMLView.registerPreprocessor("xml", "sap.ui.sample.samplepreprocessor",
/* bSyncSupport = */ false, {sampleInfo: "this is a global preprocessor",
moreInfo: "…"});</pre></div></section>
					<p>For
							more information, see <a href="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView/methods/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.registerPreprocessor" title="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView/methods/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.registerPreprocessor" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView/methods/sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.registerPreprocessor">API Reference:
									<code>sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.registerPreprocessor</code></a>.
						</p></li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Local availability</p>
					<p>Make a preprocessor available to one instance. This can be achieved by
						passing the preprocessor to the view factory function, which then processes
						it for this special instance. This would be the choice for smaller tasks the
						preprocessor should perform.</p>
					<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// "XMLView" required from module "sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView"
XMLView.create({
       viewName: "sap.ui.core.sample.View.preprocessor.Sample",
       preprocessors: {
             xml: [{
                   preprocessor: "sap.ui.sample.samplepreprocessor",
                   sampleInfo: "this is a local preprocessor",
                   moreInfo: "…"
             },
             {
                   preprocessor: “another.preprocessor”
             }]
       }
}).then(function(oView) {
       oView.doSomething();
});</pre></div></section>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>On demand availability</p>
					<p>This enables the developer to activate a preprocessor for a view instance,
						without the need to provide an implementation, by just specifying a
						preprocessor, which has been registered globally earlier. This is currently
						used by the XML templating.</p>
				</li>

					Note

				</p><p>Preprocessors are per default only available for async views. Although it is
					possible to enable the preprocessor for sync views, we strongly recommend to
					only use them with async views.</p>
