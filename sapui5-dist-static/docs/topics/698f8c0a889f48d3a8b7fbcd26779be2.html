				conditions before it passes a control to your matchers/actions/success functions. If
				your control doesn't match these conditions, you're not able to set a breakpoint.
				For such instances, OPA logs lots of information into the browser's console if you
				turn on the SAPUI5
				debug mode. You can either use the <code>sap-ui-debug=true</code> URL parameter
				or the SAPUI5

				easily found by looking through the logs.</p><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Multiple Views with the Same
					<code>viewName</code></h3>
				<p>If there are multiple views with the same <code>viewName</code>, OPA5 may not
					find the exact control you're looking for.</p>
				<p>As of version 1.62, there are a couple of ways to ensure a correct match:</p>
				<ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>viewId</code> parameter is introduced. You can set it in
								<code>Opa5.extendConfig()</code>,
								<code>Opa5.waitFor()</code> and in page object definitions.
								<code>viewId</code> can be used standalone or in combination
							with <code>viewName</code>. If OPA5 finds multiple views with the
							same name, it prompts you to add a view ID with the test failure message
							"Please provide <code>viewId</code> to locate the exact view.".</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Only views that are rendered are used in OPA5 control search.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="title ">Control Isn't Found When Running the Test on a Different Machine or
					in a Suite</h3>
				<p>The size of the iFrame in which the app is loaded is as large as the browser
					window. It's scaled down to leave space for the QUnit info but the content is
					preserved the same as when run in full size. This means that regardless of the
					small iFrame, you shouldn't see any responsive change in the app's
					appearance.</p>
				<p>If the test runs fine locally but control isn’t found on another machine, there’s
					a chance that the other machine's screen is too small and triggers the
					responsive behaviour of some controls. For example, CI executors with smaller
					screens or when the test is part of a suite and the iFrame is placed inside a
					suite wrapper much smaller than the screen.</p>
				<p>One way is to test for the responsive behavior and add conditional
						<code>waitFors</code> and test cases. Tests for different screens, such
					as phone and desktop, are better separated in different test files.</p>
				<p>If you want to work around the sizing issue and don't want to test responsive
					behavior, you can set a fixed size for the iFrame. The idea is to write the test
					for the small size which  most probably results in the central environment. You
					can use the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> parameters of
						<code>iStartMyAppInAFrame</code> or the <code>opaFrameWidth</code>
					and <code>opaFrameHeight</code> URL parameters.</p>
				<p>If either width or height isn’t defined, a default value is assigned. The default
					screen size is 1280x1024 px. The iFrame takes 60% of the screen size, which
					makes the default iFrame size to be 768x614.4 px.</p>

				<h3 class="title ">Is It the Startup That's Failing?</h3>
				<p>Maybe the app is loading too slowly for the OPA tests. If there's a local index
					file that doesn't contain the library dependencies your app needs, the SAPUI5 bootstrap is
					very slow. To fix this, add the dependencies you need in your application
					descriptor's <code>sap.ui.dependencies</code> namespace. If you don't have a
					descriptor, use the bootstrap option libs. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries (in short: app descriptor) is inspired by the WebApplication Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable, and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library." class="sap-doc">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a> and <a href="#/topic/91f2d03b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The complete list of configuration options available in SAPUI5 can be found in the API Reference under sap.ui.core.Configuration.

				<h3 class="title ">It's Failing During the Execution</h3>
				<p>If this happens, your test is probably executing actions faster than it should.
					If you encounter a failure, look at the current state of the UI - in almost all
					cases an action couldn't be triggered or a JavaScript error occurred. This error
					should be included in the console logs. If an action couldn't be executed, make
					sure that you use the action parameter of OPA5's <code>waitFor</code>
					function. When using the success function for triggering actions, OPA5 doesn't
					check many things.</p>
				<p>Here are some examples that have occurred in known apps:</p>
				<ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>An app was using the <code>bindingContext</code> of a control in a
							press handler. OPA5 was way faster than a human user, so the
							HTTP-Request that was sometimes finished by the time OPA5 was executing
							the check, was sometimes still pending and so an exception was thrown.
							The test failed because OPA was trying to reach a page that couldn't be
							shown because of this error. This had to be fixed in the app.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>When there was no action parameter available, a <code>ListItem</code>
							got rerendered while a press action was executed on it. Due to the
							rerendering, the <code>List</code> wasn't able to perform the click,
							meaning it wasn't executed and the test failed. This only happened on
							certain occasions, depending on the execution speed of the machine
							executing the test. This is now detected automatically when using
							actions.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="title ">Am I Comparing Language-Dependent Texts and the Browser Has a
					Different Language?</h3>
				<p>Check the logs to see if your matcher is failing because it's checking a text
					against a different language. If you want to always execute your tests with the
					same language, use the <code>sap-ui-language=</code> URL or bootstrap
					parameter.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">OPA Isn't Even Starting and There's No Logging Either</h2>
			<p>If you require <code>sinon-qunit.js</code>, it overwrites the browser functions
					<code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code>. OPA needs these
				functions and without them the tests don't start. You can either set the
					<code>fakeTimers</code> to <code>false</code> in your test setup, or
				maybe consider not using <code>sinon-qunit.js</code> together with OPA.</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">module("Opatests", {
    beforeEach : function () {
        sinon.config.useFakeTimers = false;

			<h2 class="title ">OPA Tests Aren't Stable</h2>
			<p>For example, the tests run fine most of the time, but they fail:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>in automated test runs</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>when run with different OPA speeds</p>

			<p>One way to stabilize your tests is to use OPA <code>autoWait</code> and

			<h2 class="title ">Working with Controls Which Set Timeouts</h2>
			<p>Examples of such controls are busy indicators, notification popups, and message toasts. These
				controls set a timeout after which the control is supposed to disappear. In some
				apps, it can be important to ensure that such a control is displayed. Note that if
				you enable <code>autoWait</code> in your tests globally, then you have to
				disable <code>autoWait</code> specifically in the <code>waitFor</code>
				statements related to these special controls. For example, if you want to test that
				a busy indicator is displayed during the sending of a request, you don't want to
				wait for controls to be interactable:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">oOpa.waitFor({
	autoWait: false,
	id: "myBusyList", // a control that is expected be covered by a busy indicator
	matchers: new PropertyStrictEquals({
		name: "busy",
		value: true
	}),
	success: function (oList) {
		Opa5.assert.ok(true, "My list is busy");
