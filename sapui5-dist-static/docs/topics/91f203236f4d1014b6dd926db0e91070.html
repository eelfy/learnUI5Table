		navigation in lists.</div><p>The helper class can be used for keyboard events in controls that need the ability to navigate
			with arrow keys over a one- or two-dimensional list of DOM nodes. The delegate hooks
			into the browser events for arrow up/down/left/right, page up/down and home/end keys.
			With a list of DOM nodes provided by the control, it sets the focus to the relevant DOM
			node in the list while handling the events.</p><p>For item navigation handling, the control has to provide a DOM node that surrounds the DOM nodes
			of all items and a list of the DOM nodes of the items. When the control is entered, the
			initial focus should be set on the surrounding DOM node. The <code>setCycling</code>
			method determines whether the focus automatically moves to the top after the end of the
			list was reached. To use the page up/down keys, a page size must be set via the
				<code>setPageSize</code> method on the delegate.</p><p>To specify a preselected item for the delegate, use the <code>setSelectedIndex</code> method.
			On reentering a control with a selected item, the method sets the focus on the list item
			that had been selected before the control was ended. If no selected index is given, the
			method sets the focus on the first item when the control is entered again.</p><p>If item navigation has to trigger a control before a focus is set, the
				<code>BeforeFocus</code> and <code>AfterFocus</code> events can be used to
			do, for example, preparation tasks for the controls visibility.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
