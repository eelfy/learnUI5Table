							<p>What does it mean when the following errors appear in the browser console?</p>
							<p>“Access to XMLHttpRequest at &lt;URL&gt; from origin &lt;ORIGIN&gt; has been blocked by the CORS policy: No

						<td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">
							<p>This usually happens when serving SAPUI5 from a different origin. The Support
								Assistant tries to load support rule definitions from there, but cannot load them - a 404 response is sent by the
								origin server. The issue is usually caused by missing or misconfigured CORS headers on the 404 response specifically.
								Besides some support rules not being loaded, this should not affect normal operation of Support Assistant.</p>

							<p>SAPUI5 library owners are encouraged to provide a
									<code>.supportrc</code> as specified by Support Assistant documentation to avoid causing 404 responses.</p>
