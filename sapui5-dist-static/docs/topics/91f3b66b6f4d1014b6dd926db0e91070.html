		and local storage.</div><p>A browser is, by design, an untrusted client: A server cannot rely on any information sent from a
			browser, as a malicious user can use a JavaScript debugger to tamper with the client
			code, or a proxy server like fiddler to modify request data. Input validation on the
			client is just for convenience purposes as the server always has to validate the data
			again that is received from the client.</p><p>Browsers also offer possible attack vectors, such as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). The application
			has to take care of these. </p><section id="section_6C7CB6E84E7E42DB821D50A02BEFF849"> 
		<h2 class="title ">Cross-Site Scripting </h2> 
		<p>Cross-Site-Scripting has become the most prominent security issue of web applications within
				the last years and also the most dangerous one, as it allows several ways of
				exploitation. Once malicious code is running within your browser, it can be used to
				steal your session cookies, to trigger requests within the current session, or even
				to exploit a known browser vulnerability to do native code execution. </p> 
				<p>For SAPUI5 applications, XSS vulnerabilities can
		  exist on different levels: 
		</p> 
		<ul class="ul "><li class="li"> 
			 <p>Within the HTML page or custom data transports
				sent to the browser from the server 
			 </p> 
		  </li><li class="li"> 
			 <p>Within the JavaScript code of the application, which is processing server responses </p> 
		  </li><li class="li"> 
		  	<p>Within the HTML renderers of SAPUI5 controls 
			 </p> 
		  </li></ul> 
				<p>SAPUI5 can only prevent
				cross-site scripting in the processing and rendering of controls. For that purpose,
				input validation exists for all typed element properties and output encoding is done
				in the renderer class of controls. However, there are exceptions for controls that
				are especially built to include arbitrary HTML, for example,
					<code>sap.ui.core.HTML</code>.</p> 
		<p>The application is responsible for the following tasks:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Proper output encoding of all content embedded in the HTML page
							itself</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Encoding JSON or XML data sent to the client</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Secure processing of the JSON/XML data</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Security of custom controls provided by the application</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>

			<h2 class="title ">Clickjacking</h2>
			<p>Clickjacking, or UI redressing, tricks the user into triggering actions within an application
				by redirecting clicks. This is done, for example, by using an invisible iFrame that
				is positioned above a fake UI. When the user clicks on something on the fake UI, the
				content of the invisible iFrame handles the click.</p>
			<p>SAPUI5 provides a way to prevent
				clickjacking since version 1.28.0. This has to be configured, as needed, by the
				application. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/62d9c4d8f5ad49aa914624af9551beb7.html" title="frameOptions is used to prevent security vulnerabilities like clickjacking. With the frameOptions configuration you define whether SAPUI5 is allowed to run embedded in a frame or only from trusted origins or not at all." class="sap-doc">Frame Options</a>. </p>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>As of version 1.28.0, you no longer need to use the Business Add-In
					<code>/UI5/BADI_CONFIG_HTTP_HANDLER</code> to configure the X-Frame-Options
				response header (SAP Note 2075016). The SAPUI5 framework now
				handles clickjacking prevention and the add-in solution won't work on all browsers. </p></div></div>

			<h2 class="title ">HTML5</h2>
			<p>HTML5 offers a lot of new functionality, which also brings a lot of potential new
				security issues. This is just an overview of some of the new features and possible
				security issues when they are used. </p>
		<section id="section_28FDB6AF8A8446FA9B40EFC0DEED90D8"> 
			<p><span class="emphasis">Local Storage</span></p> 
		<p>All browsers are now offering a local storage API.
		  This API can be used to store a limited amount of data on the browser. Access
		  to this data is limited to JavaScript code running from the same domain as it
		  has been stored. SAPUI5 offers helper functions to access the local storage on
		  different browsers. 
		</p> 
		<p>The local storage of browsers is not a secure
		  storage, so while it can be used for static data, like enumerations,
		  applications must not store any user or application data within the local
		  storage. 
		</p> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 is using the local storage of the browser
		  for the history-capability of dropdown boxes and combo boxes. 
		</p> 
	 </section><section id="section_E81EA53C91814771BF17EDD4352DE716"> 
	 	<p><span class="emphasis">WEBGL</span></p> 
		<p>While more and more browsers are supporting WEBGL by default, WEBGL allows accessing the
					graphics API of the computer on a very low level, which may also lead to low
					level exploits. This is the main reason why some browsers have no support for
					WebGL at all.</p> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 is currently not using WEBGL. 
		</p> 
	 </section><section id="section_30E13FB57F6B404BA1469FFD6802AA3F"> 
	 	<p><span class="emphasis">WebSockets</span></p> 
		<p>While WebSockets offer great new possibilities for the client/server communication of web
					applications, there have been many security issues rising while the first
					implementations were done by the browser vendors. Standardization of WebSockets
					has reached a stable state with RFC 6455 and is now implemented as of, for
					example, Chrome 16 and Firefox 11. Even if the browser implementations
					themselves prove to be secure, using WebSockets may require additional security
					measures on the client. </p> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 is currently not using WebSockets. 
		</p> 
	 </section><section id="section_73E16A2754484DA1A0D39140EE760419"> 
	 	<p><span class="emphasis">Postmessage/Onmessage</span></p> 
		<p>This is another feature in the HTML5 area, which can lead to massive security issues when not
					used correctly. <code>postMessage</code> allows inter-window-communication
					between windows from different domains. This opens a hole in the same origin
					policy currently implemented in the browser. As soon you subscribe to the
						<code>onMessage</code> event, you can receive messages from any other
					browser window. The application is responsible to check the originating domain
					and to process only messages that have been sent by trusted domains. </p> 
	 	<p>SAPUI5 uses postMessage for its
					debugging and tracing functionality. </p>
