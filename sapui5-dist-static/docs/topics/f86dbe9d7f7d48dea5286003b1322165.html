			<h2 class="title ">Supporting Different Pixel Densities</h2>
			<p>Some mobile devices, starting with iPhone4 and iPad3, have a display with a high density of
				pixels (four pixels where older models would only have one pixel). They're called
				Retina Displays by Apple to suggest they're as crisp and clear as the eye can see.
				They use four physical pixels to display one logical CSS pixel. This way images can
				be displayed much sharper when given twice as large as required because internally
				the device can use many more pixels to display all details of the image. Browsers on
				those displays do this automatically when images are scaled down.</p>
			<p>Some devices support higher resolution images while others don't. We therefore recommend that
					SAPUI5 app
				developers provide image resources for all relevant densities to provide a crisp and
				clear display of images on devices with Retina Display.</p>
			<p>The <code>sap.m.Image</code> control automatically chooses the right density depending on
				the device on which it's displayed. If an image of a certain density isn't
				available, the image control falls back to a default image, which must be provided
				as well.</p>
			<p>The image control is also used implicitly by other controls, for example:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>sap.m.Button</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>sap.m.SegmentedButton</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>sap.m.StandardListItem</code></li>
			</ul>

					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>If you don't have higher resolution images, you must set the <code>densityAware</code>
					property to <code>false</code> to avoid unnecessary roundtrips.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>

			<h2 class="title ">Example</h2>
			<p>Assume that the following controls are displayed on a device with high-density screen
					(<code>window.devicePixelRatio</code> is 2):</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">new sap.m.Image({ 
	    densityAware: false, // tells the image control that there are no different optimized image variants
	    src : "first.png"   // therefore Image control will directly load first.png 
})

new sap.m.Image({ 
    	src : "second.png"    // Image control will first look for second@2.png, then fall back to second.png
})</pre></div></section>
			<p>The first image control is told that there are no image files for the different densities, so
				it directly loads <code>first.png</code>. This image looks as good as other
				images on Retina Displays.</p>
			<p>The second image control first attempts to load <code>second@2.png</code>, which is
				twice as large as the normal image and is scaled down for display to look crisp on
				Retina Displays. If this file doesn't exist, it falls back to
					<code>second.png</code>, but this fallback causes an additional server
				request.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Naming Conventions</h2>
			<p>Density-related images are loaded if you provide an image name with density awareness in the
				following format:</p>
			<section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">[imageName]@[densityValue].[extension]</pre></div></section>
			<p>Supported densities are 1.5 and 2. The following example shows a set of images with different
				densities:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li"><code>detail.png</code> (default)</li>
				<li class="li"><code>detail@1.5.png</code></li>
				<li class="li"><code>detail@2.png</code></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p><code>detail@0.75.png</code> isn't supported
				and uses the standard image for a such low density device.</p></div></div>
