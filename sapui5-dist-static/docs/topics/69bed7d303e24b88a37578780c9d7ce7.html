				<span class="ph uicontrol">Execute</span> button on the footer of the APF Configuration
			Modeler. The configuration is launched in a separate browser window so that you can see
			the configuration and the corresponding runtime application side by side.</p><p>The configuration preview is generated using the generic APF runtime application. Since the
				generic APF runtime application does not support filters that use a function to
				determine the values, there is a restriction in previewing those filters: They are
				shown in the preview with all values selected by default, but it is not possible to
				select other values.</p><p>If a request in your
			configuration requires parameters or mandatory filters that will be handed over by
			another application in a productive system, for example, by a Smart Business KPI tile,
			the preview will not work properly. To simulate that the required parameters are handed
			over to the app, you can configure hidden filters and put them in front of all other
			filters. This ensures that the preview shows the correct data and you can test your
			application. The hidden filters do not show up on the runtime user interface. If a
			context value is handed over from outside at a later stage, this context value will take
			precedence over the default value in the configuration of the hidden filter, so you do
			not even have to remove the hidden filter. </p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="hidden relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig"></ul></section></div></section></div></body></html>
