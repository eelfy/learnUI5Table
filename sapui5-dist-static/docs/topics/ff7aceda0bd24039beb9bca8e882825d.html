			</p><p>SAPUI5 supports the
				application cache buster on SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP only.</p>
			
			<p>For Java apps on SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                Java and SAP HANA XS the
				application cache buster concept is <span class="emphasis">not</span> supported.</p>
		<p></p></div></div><p>Applications provide an index file named <code>sap-ui-cachebuster-info.json</code> (created on the fly) containing the last modified timestamps of
			all included files (like scripts, properties, or any other file that we load via XHR programmatically). Technically this file is a mapping between
			the request path (below the context path of the application) and the last modified time stamp. </p><p>The server instructs the client to cache all the above resources (not using the 304/not modified mechanism). For the index file we are using the 304/not
			modified mechanism to avoid to load when it has not been changed. </p><p>On the client side, we initially load this file of the application when enabled via configuration option <code>sap-ui-appcachebuster</code> and use
			this for the XHR requests. If the request path is contained in the above mentioned index file we simply add the time stamp as leading path segment
			to this request. If the time stamp doesnâ€™t change the URL is unique and therefore it will be taken from cache. Once the file is modified the URL
			parameter will be changed and therefore loaded again from the back end. </p><p>The server has to delete the time stamp from this URL to look up the file properly. For SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP, the logic is implemented in the ICF handler. Both back end implementations,
				SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                Java and SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP, also generate the index file on-the-fly. </p><p>
