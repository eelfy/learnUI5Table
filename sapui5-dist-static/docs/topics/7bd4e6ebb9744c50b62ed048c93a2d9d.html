		for a basic test coverage of the initial app. The tests are written independently of the
		actual data displayed in the app.</div><p>The <code>webapp</code> folder of the template app contains a
				<code>test.html</code> file which serves as an overview for the different
			test pages. You can run the app with or without mock data and run the unit and
			integration tests. This section describes which application tests are provided and how
			they are structured.</p><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Custom Mock Data</h2>
			<p>To run the automated tests below, we need a stable reference between the item on the master page and the items displayed in the line
				item table on the detail page. The mock server we use to simulate a backend system is capable of creating random entities suitable for
				testing, but it cannot foresee the dependency between the entity sets.</p>
			<p>After creating this template, we therefore need to create mock data to successfully run all automated tests delivered with this
				template.</p>
			<p>In SAP Web IDE, you can easily create
				mock data that fulfill the conditions above: Right-click on the
					<code>metadata.xml</code> file in the <code>localService</code>
				folder of your template project, and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit Mock Data</span>.
				Select the entity sets that you have chosen for the master page and the detail page,
				and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Generate Random Data</span>. The generated files will be
				put in the folder <code>localService/mockdata</code>.</p>

			<p>You can also manually download a set of json files from the actual service by appending <kbd class="ph userinput">$format=json</kbd> to the
				corresponding URL. Download the resulting files, and put them in the <code>localService/mockdata</code> folder within the
				template project.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Integration Tests</h2>
			<p>The integration tests shipped with the template cover all basic functionality and
				provide several "journeys". Journeys include a series of OPA tests that belong to
				the same functionality and should be executed together:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>NavigationJourney</code>: This journey will trigger user
							interactions and navigate through the application. The routing
							configuration, basic navigation events, and error handling are tested
							here.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>NotFoundJourney</code>: Several "not found" cases of the
							application are tested here. Faulty navigation scenarios are introduced
							intentionally to simulate errors.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>WorklistJourney</code>: A series of tests for the
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Worklist</span> page that check the busy indication
							and sharing features built into the app.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>ObjectJourney</code>: A series of tests for the
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Object</span> page that check the busy indication
							and sharing features built into the app.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>FLPIntegrationJourney</code>: This journey is available if you have enabled SAP
							Fiori launchpad (FLP) for your app. It tests the FLP integration
							features <span class="ph uicontrol">Save as tile</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Share on SAP
								Jam</span>.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><code>AllJourneys</code>: This is a convenience journey that will
							call all the other journeys specified above and is used in the test
							suite file.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>You can execute all journeys by calling the test suite file
					<code>opaTests.qunit.html</code> in the
					<code>webapp/test/integration</code> folder or selecting the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">run all integration tests</span> link in the
					<code>test.html</code> file in the app’s root folder.</p>

This makes OPA especially helpful for testing user interactions, integration with SAPUI5, navigation, and data binding." class="sap-doc">Integration Testing with One Page Acceptance Tests (OPA5)</a>
				and <a href="#/entity/sap.ui.test.Opa5" title="#/entity/sap.ui.test.Opa5" class="sap-doc" alt="#/entity/sap.ui.test.Opa5">sap.ui.test.Opa5</a> in the
						<span class="ph uicontrol">Samples</span> within the Demo Kit.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Unit Tests</h2>
			<p>In the <code>unit</code> subfolder you can find all unit tests for our
				application. They are structured similarly to the structure of the
					<code>webapp</code> folder. For example, controller tests are located in
				the <code>controller</code> folder whereas formatter tests are located in
				the <code>model</code> folder.</p>
			<p>Unit tests are included for the following functionality:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">App controller tests</li>
				<li class="li">Worklist controller tests</li>
				<li class="li">Formatters</li>
				<li class="li">Device model</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As with the integration tests, you can execute all unit tests by calling the test suite file
					<code>unitTests.qunit.html</code> in the
					<code>webapp/test/unit</code> folder or selecting the <span class="ph uicontrol">run all unit tests</span> link in the
					<code>test.html</code> file in the app’s root folder.</p>
