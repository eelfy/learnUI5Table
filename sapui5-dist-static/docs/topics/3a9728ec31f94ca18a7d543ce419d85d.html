			mock server can mimic the OData V2 back-end calls. It is designed to simulate an OData V2 provider by intercepting the HTTP communication
			made to the server, and providing a fake output. All this is transparent to the data binding and usage of the OData V2 model.</p><p>In certain scenarios, using only the built-in OData V2 simulation of the mock server is insufficient for completely server-independent tests. For
			example, if your application is using an OData feature that is not supported by the mock server, or if your application invokes a function
			import that depends on a server specific implementation (and thus is also not simulated generically). We will demonstrate how to use
			function callbacks in order to change existing mock requests.</p><p>Additionally, we will demonstrate how to mock an additional request that is not simulated out of the box by the SAPUI5 OData V2 mock server.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>

			</p><p>The tutorial describes how to use some advanced features of the mock server, disregarding the
				legal aspects of shipping mock data. Usually the mock data and mock server
				invocation is done in a test folder that is not shipped to customers. Be very
				careful that you don't ship mock data!</p>
