			<h2 class="title ">API Evolution</h2>
			<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, the word "API" in this section refers to "public API",
				meaning functions, classes, namespaces, controls along with their declared
				properties, aggregations, and so on. The sole definition of the public API is the
					
					<a href="#/api/sap.ui" title="#/api/sap.ui" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui">API Reference</a>, which is included
				in the SAPUI5 Demo Kit.
				Features that are <b>not</b> mentioned there are <b>not</b> part of the API.</p>
			<p>The following rules apply for introducing new APIs or making incompatible changes to
				existing APIs:</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Major release</span> (<span class="emphasis">x</span>.yy.zz): A new major
				version can introduce new APIs or make incompatible changes to existing APIs.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Minor release</span> (x.<span class="emphasis">yy</span>.zz): A new minor
				version can introduce new APIs but must not contain incompatible changes to
					<span class="emphasis">any</span> APIs.</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Patch release</span> (x.yy.<span class="emphasis">zz</span>): A new patch
				version only contains fixes to the existing implementation, but does not usually
				contain new features or incompatible API changes.</p>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>Exceptions to these rules are possible, but

		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Inheritance</h2>
			<p>Inheriting from SAPUI5
				objects (e.g. by calling <code>sap.ui.extend</code> on an existing control to
				add custom functionality) may endanger the updatability of your code. </p>
			<p>When overriding an SAPUI5 lifecycle method (such as <code>init</code>, <code>exit</code>,
					<code>onBeforeRendering</code>, and <code>onAfterRendering</code>), you
				must make sure that the super class implementation is called, for example like
				this:</p><section><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">MyClass.prototype.onAfterRendering = function() {
  SuperClass.prototype.onAfterRendering.apply(this);

  // do your additional stuff AFTER calling super class
}</pre></div></section><p></p>
			<p>SAP might add, remove, or change the internal implementation of the parent class at
				any time. Especially, you should not rely on the following functionality:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>Internal structures and methods that are not part of the public API</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Any internal logic and behavior of the object that is not reflected in the
						public API</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The parent hierarchy of objects especially for composites where the API
						parent differs from the real parent (e.g. parent object &gt; internal object
						&gt; child object). For
							more information, see <a href="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject" title="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject">API Reference:
									<code>sap.ui.base.ManagedObject</code></a>.
						</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>All rendering functionality of a control, including the HTML structure and
						CSS classes</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Naming collisions with SAPUI5
						structures and methods. SAPUI5 might
						introduce new API or internal structures at a later point in time that
						collide with your implementation. To avoid collisions, a custom prefix may
						be applied. Don't use namespaces starting with <code>sap.m.*</code> or
							<code>sap.ui.*</code> in your app.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We recommend that you test inherited classes very carefully after updating SAPUI5 to make sure
				that the extended functionality is still working as expected.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Deprecation</h2>
			<p>If possible and appropriate, we mark old artifacts as deprecated and create new
				artifacts, instead of making incompatible changes. A deprecation comment in the
				corresponding API documentation, and perhaps also a log entry in the implementation,
				explain why and when an artifact has been deprecated and include tips on how to
				achieve the same results without using deprecated functionality.</p>
		</section><section id="experimental">
			<h2 class="title ">Experimental API</h2>
			<p>Some features or controls delivered with the current SAPUI5 version are
				flagged as "experimental". These experimental features and controls are not part of
				the released scope of the delivered SAPUI5 version. Do not
				use experimental features or controls in a productive environment, or with data that
				has not been sufficiently backed up.</p>
			<p>Experimental features and controls can be changed or deleted at any time without
				notice, and without a formal deprecation process. They may also be incompatible to
				changes provided in an upgrade.</p>
		</section><section id="Open_Source">
			<h2 class="title ">Third-Party Open Source Libraries</h2>
			<p>SAPUI5 contains and uses
				several third-party open source libraries, such as <span class="keynote apiname">jQuery</span>. These
				libraries can also be used by applications and/or custom control libraries, but the
					SAPUI5
				compatibility rules described in this document do not apply to these third-party
				libraries.</p>
			<p>If you want to use the third-party open source libraries included in SAPUI5, note the
				following restrictions:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>SAP decides which versions and modules of the used libraries are
						provided.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>SAP can upgrade to a higher version of the used libraries even within a patch
						release.</p>
					<p> If we change to a new default version of a library, we document our
						findings that might have an effect on SAPUI5 apps
						(see <a href="#/topic/9638e4fce1bd45f4bebf7c219672908c.html" title="The following sections describe what you have to consider when upgrading to a new version of SAPUI5." class="sap-doc">Upgrading</a>). Make sure that
						you adapt your code if necessary!</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>For important reasons such as security, SAPUI5 can stop
						providing a library at any time.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The third-party libraries are provided "as is". Extensions, adaptations, and
						support are not performed or provided by SAP.</p>
				</li>
