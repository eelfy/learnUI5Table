			<h2 class="title ">Overview</h2>
			<p>OPA <code>autoWait</code> parameter is available as of version 1.48. It is a good
				practice to enable it in your tests. By default, it is not enabled in order to keep
				old tests running.</p>
			<p><code>autoWait</code> synchronizes test execution with the app. No interactions are
				attempted while the app is performing asynchronous work. This increases the
				probability that OPA statements succeed as they are only executed when the app is
				ready to respond.</p>
			<p><code>autoWait</code> is used:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>When you retrieve a control with the intent to perform an action on it</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>For every control search, when you explicitly set <code>autoWait</code>
						to <code>true</code></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><code>autoWait</code> is applied before searching for a control, which means before OPA
				check functions and matchers. If there is no work to await, the controls are
				retrieved, then actions are executed on them and lastly the success function is
				called. If there is still pending work, matchers, actions, and success function are
				skipped and OPA retries the check until it succeeds or a timeout is reached.</p>
			<p>Success functions are only called when controls are found, their state is valid and the app is
				responsive. We recommend that you use actions rather than the success function when
				interacting with a control. This ensures that the interaction is performed properly
				and the app is in a state that allows the interaction to be executed.</p>
			<p><code>autoWait</code> covers several types of asynchronous work:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Delayed work set with timeout and immediate</li>
				<li class="li">XHR requests created using XMLHttpRequests and sinon.FakeXMLHttpRequests</li>
				<li class="li">Native promises created with <code>resolve</code>, <code>all</code>,
						<code>race</code>, and <code>reject</code> functions</li>
				<li class="li">UI navigation of parent containers</li>
				<li class="li">UIArea rerendering</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Enabling <code>autoWait</code> ensures that the controls and their parents are
				visible, enabled and not busy and also that the controls are not hidden behind
				static elements, such as dialogs.</p>
			<p>If your app has ongoing asynchronous work when the OPA timeout is reached, the test fails. The
				test failure message includes details of the last detected work before the timeout.
				This type of OPA timeouts is usually caused by test instability. When writing a huge
				set of tests and executing them frequently, you might notice some tests that fail
				sporadically. Setting <code>autoWait</code> to <code>true</code> should
				stabilize most of these tests.</p>
			<p>If you decide to follow the best practices and to enable <code>autoWait</code>, we
				recommend that you do it only once in your code, near the starting point of your
				tests. You can then disable it per <code>waitFor</code> statement where needed.
				This will help you to avoid confusion when debugging test failures.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests
Opa5.extendConfig({
    autoWait: true
});
// in an OPA test
oOpa.waitFor({
    id: "myControlID",
    success: function (oControl) {
        Opa5.assert.ok(!oControl.getBusy(), "My control was not busy");
    }
});
// and then in a special waitFor case which requires a control to be non-interactable
oOpa.waitFor({
    autoWait: false,
    id: "myControlID",
    success: function (oControl) {
        // now you can explicitly check for some blocking condition
        Opa5.assert.ok(oControl.getBusy(), "My control was busy");
    }
})</pre></div></section>
			<p>If you decide to start using <code>autoWait</code> in your existing tests, the easiest way
				to migrate is to extend OPA config by enabling <code>autoWait</code>, run the
				tests to see if any <code>waitFor</code> statements timeout and then disable
					<code>autoWait</code> specifically for them.</p>

			<h2 class="title "><code>autoWait</code> and App Startup</h2>
			<p>Usually, there is a lot of time-consuming work done on app startup which can make the
				entire app noninteractive for a long time.</p>
			<p>To ensure that OPA doesn't timeout before the app is fully loaded, the timeout for
					<code>iStartMyAppInAFrame</code> and <code>iStartMyUIComponent</code> is
				increased to the default of 80 seconds.</p>
			<p>Despite the increase, there are still some tests that timeout. The timeout usually
				occurs during the first test step, which can be misleading regarding the actual
				cause of failure. <code>autoWait</code> is recommended in such cases but it is
				disabled during startup to prevent issues with module loading during app launcher
				initialization.</p>
			<p>As of version 1.54, the optional use of <code>autoWait</code> after launcher
				initialization is allowed to make sure that the app is loaded before the first test
				step. It is disabled by default for backward compatibility as some tests check for
				busy indicators on app start. You can use the option with both app launchers, for
				example:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">Given.iStartMyAppInAFrame({
    source: "applicationUnderTest/index.html",
    autoWait: true
});</pre></div></section>

			<h2 class="title "><code>AutoWait</code> and Overflow Toolbars</h2>
			<p>Under some specific circumstances, the <code>autoWait</code> is not waiting
				enough time and the next interaction happens before the awaited controls are fully
				rendered. This problem is particularly visible with overflow toolbars as the
				interaction with buttons in the toolbar happens before it is completely open and the
				included buttons are not yet ready, meaning that the interactions are lost.</p>
			<p>The root cause is a specific behavior in OPA polling when a control is found on first
				check. In this case, the next check() is synchronous, for example, it is executed
				immediately and not on the next poll interval. The problem with this implementation
				is that the synchronous check prevents the detection of subsequent flows started by
				the previous interaction. As a result, the synchronization is premature as it
				happens before the interaction is fully processed and before the UI is completely
				rendered.</p>
			<p>As of version 1.54, there is an <code>asyncPolling</code> parameter that
				overcomes this problem. It causes a postponement of the check() in the next polling
				and gives a chance for the execution flows caused by the interaction to complete.
				Unfortunately, it is not possible to make this behavior as default as there are many
				tests that are coded against the old behavior.</p>
			<p>The suggested approach is to set <code>asyncPolling</code> as default for all
					<code>waitFor</code> statements:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests
Opa5.extendConfig({
    autoWait: true,
    asyncPolling: true
});</pre></div></section>
			<p>Setting <code>asyncPolling</code> on existing tests may cause a failure because
				of the more strict synchronization. The most common uncovered problem is a test that
				is dependent on premature synchronization, such as an assertion for table rows that
				is executed before the table is fully loaded.</p>
			<p>Same parameter can be set for individual <code>waitFor</code> statements:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">// in an OPA test
oOpa.waitFor({
    id: "controlId",
    asyncPolling: true,
    success: function (oControl) {
        // TODO assert status
    }
});</pre></div></section>
