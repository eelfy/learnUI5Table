		to views, but do not have any controller or other behavior code involved.</div><p>UI parts which are to be used in several views cannot be easily defined. They either have to be
			created as new controls, or they have to be created as views. Creating them as new
			controls results in a development overhead, while creating them as separate views
			results in a runtime overhead. In the latter case they would have a separate controller
			instead of having the same controller as the view does. Also, views and popup controls
			like dialogs do not go well together. The dialog content can be defined as a view but
			the dialog control itself always has to be written in the program.</p><p>To solve these issues, fragments have been introduced. They can be reused and, if source code is required and for event handler methods, they can connect
			to existing controllers of the "owning" view. This means that one important characteristic of fragments is that they are independent of the
			model-view-controller (MVC) concept and can be used without using MVC. However, if fragments are used together with views and controllers, fragments
			can make use of them and integrate them neatly.</p><p>Similar to <code>DocumentFragments</code> in HTML, the fragment itself has no HTML
			representation when it is inserted into the UI tree. Instead, its content is inserted.
			This means that fragments are not like controls, but more like a factory creating the
			contained controls. They support reuse and view modularization without adding
			overhead.</p><p>SAPUI5 provides different types of fragments:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">XML fragments</li>
			<li class="li">HTML fragments</li>
			<li class="li">JS fragments</li>
		</ul><p>More fragment types can be implemented and plugged in.</p><p>Defining a fragment is similar to defining views within a separate file. The fragments
			simply end with <code>*.fragment</code> instead of <code>*.view</code>.
			Also, the same rules for file location apply.</p><section class="contentInSection"><h2>In this section:</h2><ul><li><a href="topic/08d220676c1c4de38fa8bbc515e2477f">HTML Fragments</a></li><li><a href="topic/2c677b574ea2486a8d5f5414d15e21c5">XML Fragments</a></li><li><a href="topic/9c069828d0064136ac6a499aa2cdace3">JS Fragments</a></li><li><a href="topic/04129b2798c447368f4c8922c3c33cd7">Instantiation of Fragments</a></li><li><a href="topic/5da591c5a5a54740948acfe56b22fbc3">Unique IDs</a></li><li><a href="topic/448c6418153149a79c8ff4370808f9c1">Dialogs and other Popups as Fragments</a></li><li><a href="topic/23b9c779c2274213a281c1fc46b4962b">Fragments with Multiple Root Nodes</a></li></ul></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig">
