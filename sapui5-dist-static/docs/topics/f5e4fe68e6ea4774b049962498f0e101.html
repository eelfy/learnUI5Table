				<h3 class="title ">Test your rule on locally running apps</h3>
			</section><p>If you want to test a Support Assistant rule on a locally running app,
				there are several steps you need to follow:</p><ol>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Start your server with the Support Assistant and support rules code loaded
						locally.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Start the app from your local server and call the Technical Information
						Dialog (available as of version 1.44).</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Press <span class="ph uicontrol">Activate Support Assistant</span> and it will load from
						your local server. If the Support Assistant is not loading, click the gear
						icon <img src="loio24b9cee6f45340778480ea25e80bf0e5_HiRes.png" usemap="#"> next to the button,
						select <span class="ph uicontrol">Recommended locations</span>, and from the dropdown
						list choose the current version app.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>After it loads, if you have correctly entered your data when creating the
						rule, you should see the title of your rule in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Available
							Rulesets</span> tab.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>To execute your rule, select it from the list and press
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Analyze</span>. Your check function will be invoked and
						then you can put a debugger in your code or insert a breakpoint and see if
						you are getting the right results.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>After your rule was executed, you will get the analysis of all results and
						the issues that it generated.</p>
				</li>
			</ol><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Test your locally modified rule on a remotely running
					app</h3>
				<p>To test your locally modified rule on other apps:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Start your server with the Support Assistant and support rules code loaded locally.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Start the app that you want to test your locally modified rule on and
							call the Technical Information Dialog (available as of version
							1.44).</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Select the gear icon <img src="loio24b9cee6f45340778480ea25e80bf0e5_HiRes.png" usemap="#"> next to the
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Activate Support Assistant</span> and select
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Custom Location</span>.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>In the input field, write the path to the Support Assistant location from
							your local server. For example,
								<kbd class="ph userinput">http://localhost:8080/testsuite/resources/sap/ui/support/</kbd>.
							This way you can load your version of the Support Assistant with the
							newly created or modified rule. If the remote app is hosted on an HTTPS
							server, the local server should run on and support HTTPS protocol.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Close the popup and select <span class="ph uicontrol">Activate Support
								Assistant</span>. You will be able to load the local version of
							the Support Assistant with the app that you want to test it on.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>To execute your rule, select it from the list and choose
								<span class="ph uicontrol">Analyze</span>. Your check function will be invoked
							and then you can put a debugger in your code or insert a breakpoint and
							see if you are getting the right results.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>After your rule was executed, you will get the analysis of all results
							and the issues that it generated.</p>
