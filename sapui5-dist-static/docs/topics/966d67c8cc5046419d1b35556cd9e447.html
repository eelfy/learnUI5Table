			<h2 class="title ">Loading Large Amounts of Data</h2>
			<p>A critical factor for application performance is the loading of data from a server. The runtime of triggered requests depends on the
				number of records retrieved. Loading large amounts of data may also have a negative impact on memory consumption.</p>
			<p>To this end, lists and tables offer mechanisms to load only a limited amount of data while still displaying required data to the user.
				For example, the <code>sap.ui.table.Table</code> requests the records to be displayed to the user plus a
					<code>threshold</code>. A reasonable default value for the threshold is provided by the table. Make sure to use such paging
				mechanisms to create applications with good performance. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/148892ff9aea4a18b912829791e38f3e.html" title="The libraries provided by SAPUI5 contain various different table controls that are suitable for different use cases. The table below outlines which table controls are available, and what features are supported by each one." class="sap-doc">Tables: Which One Should I Choose?</a></p>
			
			<p>Whenever you use methods like <a href="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/requestContexts" title="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/requestContexts" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/requestContexts"><code>sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#requestContexts</code></a>, <a href="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/read" title="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/read" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/read"><code>sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#read</code></a>, or <a href="#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel/methods/loadData" title="#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel/methods/loadData" class="sap-doc" alt="#/api/sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel/methods/loadData"><code>sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel#loadData</code></a>, or create XHR requests in application code, <span class="emphasis">your

					not be performed on the client:</span></p>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">Aggregating large amounts of data of which only a small amount is displayed. Such aggregations are preferably performed
						directly in the database to avoid moving all the raw data over the network and onto different computers.</li>
					<li class="li">Performing mass operations, such as mass changes. Such operations shall be performed by the server, e.g. by an <a href="#/topic/b54f7895b7594c61a83fa7257fa9d13f.html" title="The OData V4 model supports OData operations (ActionImport, FunctionImport, bound Actions and bound Functions).

				</p><p>SAPUI5 does not set limits on the amount of data to be loaded by your
					application. However, some browsers may do, which would cause your application to fail if it loads large amounts of data.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Don't use visibility for lazy instantiation</h2>
			<p>When an application has areas that are not visible initially, or if only one of multiple options is visible at a time, <span class="emphasis">do
					not</span> create all UI controls and set most of them to non-visible! If you do, SAPUI5 will instantiate and initialize all of those controls, which consumes
				unnecessary time and memory, even when they are not rendered. On top of this, the data binding will also be initialized, which may trigger
				back-end requests that are not needed at this stage. The impact is particularly big when the parts of the UI that are not visible initially are
				complex or numerous.</p>
			<p>Please note that lazy loading of views can be achieved with routing. For more information, see <a href="#/topic/3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5.html" title="SAPUI5 offers hash-based navigation, which allows you to build single-page apps where the navigation is done by changing the hash. In this way the browser does not have to reload the page; instead there is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react. A hash string is parsed and matched against patterns which will then inform the handlers." class="sap-doc">Routing and Navigation</a> and <a href="#/topic/cdab0a1123514cc08cf2c8deb22f312e.html" title="In the previous steps, we have implemented a Resume view that uses tabs to display data. The complete content of the tabs is loaded once, no matter which tab is currently displayed. We can increase the performance of our app by avoiding to load content that is not visible. Therefore, we implement a lazy loading feature that only loads the view and data when requested by the user." class="sap-doc">Step 10: Implement "Lazy Loading"</a> of the Navigation and Routing

			<div class="note other example "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Example
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
				</p><p>An application needs to display a <code>Panel</code> containing a <code>Table</code> in <span class="emphasis">display mode</span>, but the
					user can switch to <span class="emphasis">edit mode</span> to modify data, in which case a different <code>Panel</code> needs to be shown.
					Especially when using XML views, it is tempting for application developers to specify two panels in the view XML and set the
						<code>Panel</code> with the editable table to <code>visible="false"</code>. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit</span> button could then
					just toggle visibility of both panels.</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>The following XML view is easy to handle, but leads to suboptimal performance when the <code>editPanel</code> has a lot of content.</p>
			<p>View:</p>
			<section class="lang-xml"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;mvc:View xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" xmlns="sap.m" controllerName="my.own.controller"&gt;
	&lt;Page&gt;
                        
		&lt;Panel id="displayPanel" headerText="Display Data"&gt;
			&lt;Table...&gt;
		&lt;/Panel&gt;
                        
		&lt;!-- edit panel is initially hidden, but still instantiated --&gt;
		&lt;Panel id="editPanel" headerText="Edit Data" visible="false"&gt;
			&lt;Table...&gt; 
		&lt;/Panel&gt;
                        
		&lt;Button text="Edit" press="toEditMode"/&gt;
	&lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Controller code:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">sap.ui.define([
	"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller",
	"sap/ui/core/Fragment"
], function (Controller, Fragment) {
	"use strict";
	return Controller.extend("my.own.controller", {
		toEditMode: function() {
			this.byId("displayPanel").setVisible(false);
			this.byId("editPanel").setVisible(true);
		}
	});
});</pre></div></section>
			<p>The following code is better in terms of initial performance because the second table is created lazily when the user switches to edit mode.</p>
			<p>View:</p>
			<section class="lang-xml"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;mvc:View xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" xmlns="sap.m" controllerName="my.own.controller"&gt;
	&lt;Page&gt;
            
		&lt;!—only the initially needed display panel --&gt;
		&lt;Panel id="displayPanel" headerText="Display Data"&gt;
			&lt;Table...&gt;
		&lt;/Panel&gt;
      
		&lt;Button text="Edit" press="toEditMode"/&gt;
	&lt;/Page&gt;
&lt;/mvc:View&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Additional fragment named <code>EditPanel.fragment.xml</code> for content that is initially hidden:</p>
			<section class="lang-xml"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">&lt;Panel xmlns="sap.m" id="editPanel" headerText="Edit Data" visible="false"&gt;
	&lt;Table...&gt;
&lt;/Panel&gt;</pre></div></section>
			<p>Controller code:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">	...
	toEditMode: function() {
		this.byId("displayPanel").setVisible(false);

		if (!this.pEditPanel) {
			// load and instantiate the edit panel lazily
			// we keep the Promise of the Fragment.load() call,
			// so that we do not trigger the fragment loading everytime the user clicks the button
			this.pEditPanel = Fragment.load({
				name: "myApp.EditPanel",
				// giving the View ID to the Fragment.load() function will prefix the IDs in the Fragment and allows using this.byId(…) in the Controller
				// giving “this” (the Controller) allows using controller methods from within the Fragment
				id: this.getView().getId(),
				type: "XML",
				controller: this
			}).then(function (oFragment) {
				this.byId("myPage").insertContent(oFragment, 0); // for sake of simplicity inserts at position 0
			}.bind(this));
		}
		// we chain the visibility change of the "editPanel" to the loading Promise
		// Since we only load the fragment one we can chain ourselves to this Promise on each Button click
		this.pEditPanel.then(function() {
			var oEditPanel = this.byId("editPanel");
			oEditPanel.setVisible(true);
		}.bind(this));
	}
	...</pre></div></section>
			<p>In other scenarios, at the time of developing you may not know which UI part is displayed initially. In this case, you can define that the UI is
				empty (showing none of the panels) in the view definition, and the controller’s <code>onInit()</code> method decides which fragment to
				instantiate and display initially:</p>
			<section class="lang-js"><div class="fig fig-codeblock"><pre class="codeblock prettyprint">	...
	toEditMode: function () {...},
	onInit: function () {
		// we keep the loading Promise, so we can chain ourselves to it later
		this.pEditPanel = Fragment.load({
			name: bEditMode ? "myApp.EditPanel" : "myApp.DisplayPanel",
			type: "XML"
		}).then(function (oFragment) {
			this.byId("myPage").insertContent(oFragment, 0); // for sake of simplicity inserts at position 0
		});
	}
	...</pre></div></section>

				</p><p>Although the example above shows an XML view and an XML fragment, the problem and the solution apply to all view types.</p>
				<p>Please also note that this guideline is not set in stone: If the hidden UI elements are just small or few in number, using fragments would
					not help but add additional overhead instead. Having said that, creating several big tables and displaying only one of them is
						<span class="emphasis">not</span> a good idea. There is no definite rule where to draw the line, it depends on many factors like application
					size, number of libraries being loaded, and additional data requested by those hidden controls. If in doubt, you can test the performance
					using the performance tracing tools in the browser’s developer console with the controls in question being hidden, against them being
					removed.</p>
