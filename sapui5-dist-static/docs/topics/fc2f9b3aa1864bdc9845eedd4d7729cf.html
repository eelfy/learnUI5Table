			<li class="li">You configure a filter for a property in your application.</li>
			<li class="li">A value help request determines the entries in the value help list.</li>
			<li class="li">The Smart Business KPI tile passes a filter for the same property in the
				context.</li>
		</ul><p>As a result, the value help for the filter lists all values retrieved by the value help
			request. By default, those values are preselected that were passed as filters with the
			Smart Business context. </p><p>As in use case 2, if the context contains operators other than just single values, an
			additional context resolution request is required. This request resolves the context
			into a list of single values. In the value help, these single values are then selected
			by default. </p><p>To configure a filter for this use case, you must enter basic data for the filter definition
			and information for the value help. </p><p>To configure the context resolution request, enter the required information in the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Context Resolution</span> section.</p><p>The option described above is depicted in the following figure:</p><img src="loioba04452e85a24a5aa88a70d0a0d3aa67_LowRes.png" usemap="#"><section><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>
					Example
				</h2></div><div class="fig">
			<p>You configure a filter for the property <span class="ph sap-technical-name">CompanyCode</span>.
				You define a value help request that retrieves all company codes that are available.
				These are listed in the value help for the filter. </p>
			<p>The Smart Business context passes company codes 1000 and 2000 as filters. These company codes
				are then preselected in the filter. The user can, for example, add more company
				codes to the analysis as required.</p>
