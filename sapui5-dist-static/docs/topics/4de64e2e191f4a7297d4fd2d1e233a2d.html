			not possible to inject script code into an application page that
		runs in a browser.</div><p>Controls must prohibit writing scripts to the page that comes from the application or from
			business data saved by a different user. To ensure this, the following two measures must
			be combined:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>Validation of typed control properties</p>
				<p>SAPUI5 core validates the value
					of properties set by the application against the type of the property. This
					guarantees that an <code>int</code> is always an <code>int</code>, and a
						<code>sap/ui/core/library.CSSSize</code> is a string representing a CSS
					size and does <span class="emphasis">not</span> contain a script tag. This also applies
					to enumerations and control IDs. The control renderer can rely on this check
					when writing the HTML. Property values that are typed in this way can be written
					without escaping.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Escaping</p>
				<p>Control developers must ensure that string control properties and other values coming from
					the application and not sufficiently typed to rule out script tags being
					contained are escaped when written to the HTML. For this, the
						<code>sap/ui/core/RenderManager</code> and SAPUI5 core provide
					helper methods.</p>
			</li>
		</ul><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Avoiding XSS for a New Renderer</h2>
			<p>To ensure maximum security for a renderer, note the following:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>For control properties, always use the most specific type that is available. For example,
						use <code>sap.ui.core.CSSSize</code> instead of <code>string</code>
						and instead of <code>sap/ui/core/library.string</code> for control
						properties that refer to a CSS size.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Use helper methods from the <code>RenderManager</code> instance (used below as
							<code>oRenderManager</code>), which is provided to the
							<code>render</code> method of the respective renderer to escape the
						value of a string property that is written to the HTML:</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">
							<p>Use <code>oRenderManager.writeEscaped(oControl.getSomeStringProperty()</code> instead
								of just <code>write(...)</code> for writing plainly to the
								HTML.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Use <code>oRenderManager.writeAttributeEscaped("someHtmlProperty",
									oControl.getSomeStringProperty())</code> instead of just
									<code>writeAttribute(...)</code> for writing attributes.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="li">
							<p>Use <code>sap/base/security/encodeXML</code> for string properties where none of the
								other two options is possible to escape the string and then process
								it further.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>Check your HTML coding whether application values can make their way into the HTML:</p>
					<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">Check where the variable values come from: Can the application set a value directly or
							only decide which of the hardcoded values are used?</li>
						<li class="li">Escape values given in parameters in method calls of controls because they are currently
							not validated by SAPUI5
							core.</li>
						<li class="li">Keep in mind that XSS can happen anywhere and anytime in CSS classes, or in styles.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
