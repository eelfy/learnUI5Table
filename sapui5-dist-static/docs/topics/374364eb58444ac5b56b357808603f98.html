				<h3 class="title ">Shipped BSP-Application - Unchanged</h3>
				<p>If you want to launch a shipped APF-based application without making any changes
					to it, entering a configuration title is not required. The configuration can be
					read directly from the analytical configuration file of the BSP application. The
					location of this file is specified in the <code>manifest.json</code> file,
					which is part of the BSP application.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Shipped BSP-Application - Enhanced</h3>
				<p>If you have imported the JSON file of a shipped application into the APF
					Configuration Modeler, ensure that the semantic object entered in the APF
					Configuration Modeler app is the same as the one you enter here. The semantic
					object and the action are used to determine the KPIs navigation target. </p>
				<p>You must select a configuration to be able to launch the application. The
					corresponding configuration ID takes precedence over the location of the
					analytical configuration file of the BSP application. To select the
					configuration title, use the value help. The semantic object filters the list of
					configurations so that only those are listed that have been created for the
					specified semantic object. A configuration title has a corresponding
					configuration ID, which is unique.</p>
			</section><section>
				<h3 class="title ">Generic Runtime Application</h3>
				<p>Selecting a configuration is also mandatory if you use the generic runtime
					application. The generic runtime application does not contain a reference to the
					location of the analytical configuration file and therefore must be
					parameterized using a configuration ID. To select the configuration title, use
					the value help. The semantic object filters the list of configurations so that
					only those are listed that have been created for the specified semantic object.
					A configuration title has a corresponding configuration ID, which is unique.</p>
