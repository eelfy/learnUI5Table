			(manifest.json), the component (Component.js),
		and the main view of the app (App.view.xml).</div><div><div class="fig"><img src="loioeeae30fe7983476a9777e809a8820147_LowRes.png" usemap="#"></div></div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Descriptor (<code>manifest.json</code>)</h2>
			<p>We recommend that you use the <code>manifest.json</code> file to configure the app
				settings and put all important information needed to run the app in there. Using
				this approach means you need to write less application code, and you can already
				access the information before the app is instantiated.</p>
			<p>Some attributes in the descriptor are just for information purposes, such as the minimum SAPUI5 version
					(<code>minUI5version</code>), others help external components (for example
				the SAP Fiori launchpad
					(FLP)) to integrate
				the application correctly, but most of the attributes are actually used to configure
				specific aspects of the app that are needed frequently.</p>
			<p>The most important configuration settings are:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Models</span>. Examples of models are the configuration of the OData service
							(default model) and language files (i18n model). All models described in
							the <code>manifest.json</code> file are automatically
							instantiated when the app is started. </p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Libraries</span> and <span class="emphasis">components</span> that are used in the app
							and have to be loaded during app initialization.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>The <span class="emphasis">root view</span> of your application.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Routing</span> configuration that defines the navigation between views.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Root View (<code>App.view.xml</code>)</h2>
			<p>The <code>App.view.xml</code> file defines the root view of the app. In most cases, it
				contains an <code>App</code> control or a <code>SplitApp</code> control as a
				root control.</p>
			<p>SAPUI5 supports multiple view
				types (XML, HTML, JavaScript, JSON). We recommend using XML views, as for these you
				have to separate the controller logic from the view definition in a controller file
				(for example <code>App.controller.js</code>). </p>
			<p>We also recommend creating a separate view file for each view you want to use in your app.</p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Component (<code>Component.js</code>)</h2>
			<p>The <code>Component.js</code> file holds the app setup. The
					<code>init</code> function of the component is automatically started by SAPUI5 when the
				component is instantiated.</p><div class="note caution  "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Caution
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
					</p><p>Your component extends <code>UIComponent</code>. If you are overriding the init function
						of your component, you have to make sure that you call the
							<code>init</code> function of <code>UIComponent</code> and
						initialize the router afterwards.</p>
				<p></p></div></div>In the metadata section of the component, you define a reference to the
				descriptor file. When the component is instantiated, the descriptor is loaded and
				parsed automatically.<p></p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">HTML Page</h2>
			<p>All apps are started using an HTML page that loads SAPUI5 and the
				component. You have two options: You can build an app for the FLP or build a standalone
				app.</p>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">App for FLP</span></p>
						<p>The FLP instantiates the
							component based on the information given in the descriptor file. The
								FLP can
							contain multiple apps at the same time. Each app can define local
							settings, such as supported themes or supported devices.</p>
						<p>This app cannot be run standalone, meaning no <code>index.html</code> file is
							created but only HTML files for testing the app in the FLP sandbox.</p>
						<p>For more information, search for <span class="ph uicontrol">Embedding SAPUI5 Applications</span> in
							the documentation of your SAP NetWeaver version
							on the SAP Help Portal at <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER" title="https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_NETWEAVER</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Standalone app</span></p>
						<p>If you want to run your app standalone, you need to create an <code>index.html</code> file. Within this file, you
							instantiate the component.</p>
					</li>
