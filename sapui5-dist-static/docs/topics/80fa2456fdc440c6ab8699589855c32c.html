			is, one set of texts for all configurations belonging to an application node. This is
			useful if you have configurations that share large parts of their texts, for example,
			because they are very similar as far as their content is concerned.</p><p>When you export a configuration, the corresponding text pool can be exported too, for example,
			for translation purposes. However, in certain cases, texts that are no longer used may
			exist in the text pool. For example, if you change a text, both the old text and the new
			one are retained in the text pool, even if you only correct a typo. When workin in the
			APF Configuration Modeler, you can only add texts to the text pool, but not change or
			remove them. Therefore, to keep your text pool as small as possible and save translation
			costs, we recommend performing a text pool cleanup whenever you want to export a text
			pool. Otherwise, obsolete texts may end up in the translation process.</p><p>On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Application Overview</span> screen, choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">Text Pool
				Cleanup</span> icon for the application for which you want to perform the text
			pool cleanup.</p><section class="contentInSection hidden"><h2>In this section:</h2></section><section class="familyLinks"><div class="parentLink hidden"><br><strong>Parent topic: </strong></div><div class="previousLink hidden"><br><strong>Previous: </strong></div><div class="nextLink hidden"><br><strong>Next: </strong></div></section><section class="relatedLinks "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon title"><h2>Related information</h2></div><ul class="fig">
