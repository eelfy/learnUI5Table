		handler, and content-specific functionality.</div><section>
			<h2 class="title ">SAPUI5 ABAP
				Repository</h2>
			<p>The SAPUI5 ABAP repository
				uses BSP applications to store SAPUI5 apps, components, and
				libraries. To be precise, for text files it uses the page fragments and pages with
				flow logic of the BSP applications, and for binary files the MIME objects of the BSP
				applications.</p>
			<p>As mentioned above, don't edit the BSP applications in transaction
					<code>SE80</code>. Instead use the appropriate development tools which use
				the SAPUI5 ABAP repository
				APIs to ensure the integrity of the data.</p>
			<p>The SAPUI5 ABAP repository supports explorer-like file and folder structures.
				Therefore the BSP repository is enhanced accordingly to also support file and folder structures. This means that the sources of an app
				might look different in a BSP application compared to the corresponding single SAPUI5 repository when viewing it in SAP Business Application Studio:</p>
			<ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">Path mapping in XML (<code>UI5RepositoryPathMapping.xml</code>)</li>
				<li class="li">GUID-like or hash-like names</li>
				<li class="li">Texts looking different to the version at runtime:<ul class="ul ">
						<li class="li">Trailing spaces in text lines are escaped with <code>&nbsp;</code> in the respective BSP pages.</li>
						<li class="li">Lines longer than 254 characters are broken into multiple lines and get a plus (+) on position 255.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>A BSP application representing a single SAPUI5 repository
						uses the application class <code>/UI5/CL_UI5_BSP_APPLICATION</code>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Runtime Handler</h2>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">For runtime access, each single SAPUI5 repository has
						an ICF node beneath node <code>/sap/bc/ui5_ui5</code>.</li>
					<li class="li">Handler classes are assigned to node <code>/sap/bc/ui5_ui5</code> for
						the following purposes:<ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">Accessing SAPUI5 ABAP
								repository content</li>
							<li class="li">SAPUI5
								distribution layer including SAPUI5 core
								libraries</li>
						</ul></li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>
		</section><section>
			<h2 class="title ">Content-Specific Functionality</h2>
			<p>In general, the SAPUI5 ABAP
				repository and runtime access to resources do not make assumptions regarding its
				content. However, there are the following exceptions:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">The <code>index.html</code> files are realized as pages with flow logic in the BSP application (whereas all other text files are realized
						as page fragments). In this way, they can be tested directly in transaction <code>SE80</code>.</li>
					<li class="li">There is a special logic for runtime handling of properties files (resource
						bundles) in the form of a server-side locale fallback. This means that if a
						properties file for a specific locale is requested and does not exist, the
						next matching properties file is returned.</li>
				</ul><p></p>
