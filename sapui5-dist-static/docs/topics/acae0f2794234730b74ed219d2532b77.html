			sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar controls, sharing the same data source. It can be used as a starting point for building a
		complex application with the full functionality that these controls offer (adding, editing, deleting and moving of appointments,
		etc.).</div><section id="section_tnq_nnx_vkb">
			<p>The demo application provides the following features and elements:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Team Calendar</span> page, where all the members of the team are displayed with their appointments -
							represented by <code>sap.m.PlanningCalendar</code>.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Team Member Calendar</span>, where appointments of a single selected member are displayed - represented by
								<code>sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</code>.</p>
					</li>
				</ul><p></p>
			<p>There are some additional buttons (<code>sap.m.Button</code>), that activate features like Calendar Legend and Create Appointment.
				Integration (OPA) tests are also included in the functionality demonstrated by the application. The data in this model include also
				settings used for application setup like start date and initially selected view for both calendars, supported appointment types, etc.
				The application is built with Dynamic Page control (<code>sap.f.DynamicPage</code>) and the switch between the two calendars
				happens without loading of the pages. Calendars are loaded as fragments in a container within the Dynamic Page content aggregation. For more information about the features and options for extending the app, see the Demo Kit Sample pages for <a href="#/entity/sap.m.PlanningCalendar" title="#/entity/sap.m.PlanningCalendar" class="sap-doc" alt="#/entity/sap.m.PlanningCalendar">sap.m.PlanningCalendar</a> and <a href="#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar" title="#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar" class="sap-doc" alt="#/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar">sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</a>.</p>
