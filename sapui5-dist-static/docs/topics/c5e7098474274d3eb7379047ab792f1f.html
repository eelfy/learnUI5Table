			</p><p>The index is used by several different services such as the SAP Fiori launchpad and cache
				buster. This means you have to make sure that the index is updated using the
				calculation report whenever the content of the SAPUI5 ABAP repository has
				changed. For more information whether the report is executed automatically or you
				have to run it manually, see <a href="#/topic/fbce0ba7a31f4073959efd705924af45.html" title="Changes to the content of the SAPUI5 ABAP repository require the index to be updated using the calculation report /UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE. Depending on how the content of the repository is changed, the report is executed automatically or you have to run it manually." class="sap-doc">Calculation Report - Automatic Run vs. Manual Scheduling</a>.</p>
			<p>Also descriptor and component IDs used in single SAPUI5 repositories have to
				be unique and valid. Fore more information, see <a href="#/topic/3dd37367d73945bcae39301e12a4eee4.html" title="There are two checks you can do: Are my component IDs unique and valid? Does my app have the necessary SAPUI5 ICF node or are there unnecessary ICF nodes?" class="sap-doc">Check Your SAPUI5 Application</a>.</p>
		<p></p></div></div><p>The index makes it possible to retrieve and find this information significantly faster
			than when carrying out the calculations each time it's requested. The index is also
			required, for example, for finding the paths to SAP Fiori libraries.</p><p>The index contains the following:</p><ul class="ul ">
				<li class="li">
					<p>Cache busting information on the level of single and multiple application
						resources</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p>Certain properties or attributes (for example, component ID, used library, or

						libraries</p>
