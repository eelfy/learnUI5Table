		operates.</div><p>The business data within a model can be defined using various formats:</p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>OData</p>

				<p>Your own custom format (not covered in this tutorial) </p>
			</li>

					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
			</p><p>There is also a special type of model called a "resource model". This model type is
				used as a wrapper object around a resource bundle file. The names of such files must
				end with <code>.properties</code> and are used typically for holding
				language-specific text.</p>
			<p>We will use this in <a href="#/topic/9790d9aa686e4f818f2ad99057adb7ee.html" title="Business applications also require language-specific (translatable) texts used as labels and descriptions on the user interface." class="sap-doc">Step 6: Resource Models</a>.</p>
		<p></p></div></div><p>When JSON, XML and resource models are created, the data they contain is loaded in a
			single request (either from a file stored locally on the client or by requesting it from
			a Web server). In other words, after the model's data has been requested, the entire
			model is known to the application. These models are known as client-side models and
			tasks such as filtering and sorting are performed locally on the client.</p><p>An OData model however, is a server-side model. This means that whenever an application needs
			data from the model, it must be requested from the server. Such a request will almost
			never return all the data in the model, typically because this would be far more data
			than is required by the client application. Consequently, tasks such as sorting and
			filtering should always be delegated to the server.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will focus on JSON models since they are the simplest ones to work
			with.</p><section>

	"sap/m/Text",
	"sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel"
], function (Text, JSONModel) {
	"use strict";

	// Attach an anonymous function to the SAPUI5 'init' event

			<p>Create a new JSON model passing the data as object literal and store the resulting
				model instance in a local variable called <code>oModel</code>.</p>
			<p>Set <code>oModel</code> to be the default model within the entire SAPUI5 core.</p>
			<p>This makes the model object globally available to all controls used within the
				application.</p>
			<p>In this case we have bound the model object to the SAPUI5 core. This has been done
				for simplicity, but is not considered good practice. Generally speaking, a model object holding business data should be bound to the
				app's <code>Component.js</code> or to the view that displays the data. For an example, see the Walkthrough tutorial, <a href="#/topic/70ef981d350a495b940640801701c409.html" title="Now that we have set up the view and controller, it’s about time to think about the M in MVC." class="sap-doc">Step 7: JSON Model</a> (binding to the View) or <a href="#/topic/4cfa60872dca462cb87148ccd0d948ee.html" title="After we have introduced all three parts of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept, we now come to another important structural aspect of SAPUI5." class="sap-doc">Step 9: Component Configuration</a>
				(binding to the Component).</p>

				</p><p>Models can be set on every control by calling <code>setModel()</code>. The model is then
					propagated to all aggregated child controls (and their children, and so on…).
					All child control will then have access to that model</p>
			<p></p></div></div>
			<p>The text that is displayed on the UI is still hard-coded and not taken from the model - we will bind the property <code>greetingText</code>
				to our UI control in the next step.</p>
