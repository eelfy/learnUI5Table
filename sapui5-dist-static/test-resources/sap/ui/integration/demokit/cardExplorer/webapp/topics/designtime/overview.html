			<h1 id="overview">Overview of Integration Card Design-time</h1>

			<p>After you finsished creating a Integration Card as a developer, you should think about the possible
				configuration options needed by the integrator personas.<br>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Which settings does an Administrator on the customer side need to edit to get the Card connected to
					a datasource?</li>
				<li>Are the other mandatory settings that are needed before the Card will show a valuable result?</li>
				<li>Which settings would you like to offer to the administrator or page/content administrator?</li>
				<li>Would any translation be needed for your settings?</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 id="personas">Understanding Responsibilities and Personas for Card Integration</h2>
			<p>
				Integration Cards are used to define reusable UI blocks that can be embedded into various Host
				environments.
				While developing and integrating a Card, various personas can be involved to bring a Card to "live" for
				an end-user.
				Each persona has a certain responisbility during the integration process.
				Tooling offered to those personas need to specialize for their knowledge and needs.
				Today the following personas are targeted.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Card Developer</strong><br>Responsible for to create a card template that can be integrated
					into various Host environments</li>
				<li><strong>Administrator</strong><br>Responsible to connect the Card to
					the right data and
					pre-configure the Card for usage on pages or dashboards.</li>
				<li><strong>Page/Content Administrator</strong><br>Responsible to embed and configure Card
					instances in pages and
					dashboards.</li>
				<li><strong>Translator</strong><br>Responsible to translate texts on the Card to different
					languages if needed.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 id="carddeveloper">Integration Card Developer</h3>
			<p>
				This is the technical guy in the group. Usually he works as a developer and builds a Card from scratch.
				He will define the later purpose of the Card, defines default configuration, appearance and interaction
				of the Card.
				Usually this persona might not even work in the same company as the other personas.
				He acts as a provider of an Integration Card template that can be used later by the others to integrate
				into a real host environment.
				Also other responsibilities are attached to the developer. He has to take care of versioning,
				compatibility, initial translations. <br>
				Lastly he is also responsible to define the configuration options that should be offered to the "next"
				persona, the Administrator.
			</p>
			<h3 id="cardadmin">Administrator</h3>
			<p>
				Less technical, the Administrator, does the first step of Card integration on the consumer side for a
				particular Host environment.
				He will configure the destination/connectivity to data sources needed by the card. Those configuration
				vary depending from consumer to
				consumer and normally cannot be pre-configured by a developer.<br>
				Additionally he will set default values that make sense for Page/Content Administrators to cover the 80%
				case of the usages by Page/Content Administrators.
				If needed, he can also hide certain configuration to avoid misuse or confusion.

				<br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="cardcontentadmin">Page/Content Administrator</h3>
			<p>
				This person knows the business context where to integrate the ready to use card provided by the
				Administrator.<br>
				He knows the needs of the end-user and their expectation of the presented Card content.
				<br><br>
				<a class="try-button" href="../../index.html#/explore/designtimeContent" target="_parent">Try it Out</a>
				<br>
			</p>
			<h3 id="cardtranslator">Translator</h3>
			<p>
				A translator is responsible for text translations. While, most often a Page/Content Administrator will
				maintain certain settings
				only in one language, a translator can be involved for internationalization. He is familiar with the
				context terminology for the end-users that use the Card.

			</p>

			<h2 id="cardeditor">Card Editor</h2>
			<p>
				The Card Editor supports the personas that need to configure cards on the customer side.
			<ul>
				<li>Administrator</li>
				<li>Page/Content Administator</li>
				<li>Translator</li>
			</ul>
			The developer normally works within Business Application Studio and uses a specialized editor in this
			environment to create a Card from scratch.
